# Epic 3 Retrospective - 2025-11-16

## Summary
- Stories completed: 7/7, blockers: 0, debt backlog entries: 6
- QA: All new modules passed Black/Ruff/Mypy + integration suites
- Stakeholders accepted, deployment staged with next release window

## Team Participants
Bob (SM), Alice (PO), Charlie (Dev), Dana (QA), Elena (Dev), andrew (Project Lead)

## Successes
- Organizer + OutputWriter unified multi-format delivery without regressions
- Documentation and AC evidence tables accelerated QA sign-off
- Bridge-epic prep eliminated mid-sprint blockers

## Challenges
- Story templates lacked reminders for provenance/logging/wiring
- AC evidence often backfilled post-review, causing rework

## Key Insights
- Invest in scriptable scaffolding to embed development guidelines
- Enforce completion via tooling so humans focus on complex work

## Follow-through from Epic 2 Retro
Completed: Quality gate automation, BMAD UAT workflows, Bridge Epic 2.5, Performance profiling
Pending: CLAUDE.md lessons section, Test-dependency audit doc

## Next Epic Preview (Epic 4: Foundational Semantic Analysis)
Dependencies: Chunks+metadata from Epic 3, Organizer/CLI infrastructure
Prep Needs: Add scikit-learn/joblib/textstat, Template generator tooling, Model storage ADR, Semantic QA fixtures, TF-IDF/LSA playbook

## Action Items
- Story/Review Template Generator (Owner: Elena + DevOps, Deadline: 2025-11-20)
- CLAUDE.md Lessons section (Owner: Bob, Deadline: 2025-11-21)
- Test-dependency audit doc (Owner: Winston, Deadline: 2025-11-22)
- Backlog cleanup assignments (Owner: Alice, Deadline: 2025-11-23)

## Preparation Tasks
- Add semantic dependencies + smoke test (Owner: Charlie, Est: 4h)
- Model/Cache ADR (Owner: Winston, Est: 4h)
- Semantic QA fixtures (Owner: Dana, Est: 6h)
- TF-IDF/LSA playbook (Owner: Charlie + Elena, Est: 4h)

## Critical Path
- Complete template generator + CLAUDE lessons before Story 4.1 planning
- Semantic dependencies + ADR before semantic stories hit review
- Schedule Epic 4 planning review after prep items underway

## Significant Discoveries
- Missing automation/templates caused repeated AC/provenance misses
- Dependency audit process still undocumented

## Readiness Assessment
- Testing Quality: Ready
- Deployment: Staged with next release window
- Stakeholder Acceptance: Complete
- Technical Health: Stable
- Unresolved Blockers: None beyond prep tasks

## Next Steps
- Execute ~2.5-day preparation sprint
- Complete critical path items before Epic 4
- Review action items in next standup
