# Engineering Backlog

This backlog collects cross-cutting or future action items that emerge from reviews and planning.

Routing guidance:

- Use this file for non-urgent optimizations, refactors, or follow-ups that span multiple stories/epics.
- Must-fix items to ship a story belong in that story's `Tasks / Subtasks`.
- Same-epic improvements may also be captured under the epic Tech Spec `Post-Review Follow-ups` section.
