## Mitigation Plans

### R-001: Chunking splits mid-sentence creating incomplete context (Score: 6)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Implement spaCy sentence boundary detection in Story 3.1 chunking engine
- Handle edge cases: very long sentences (>512 tokens), micro-sentences, no punctuation
- Sliding window algorithm respects sentence boundaries: never split mid-sentence
- Edge case: if sentence exceeds chunk_size, split at clause boundaries (fallback to character split with warning)

**Owner:** DEV Team
**Timeline:** Sprint 1 Week 1
**Status:** Planned
**Verification:**
- Unit tests: 5 edge cases (long sentences, no punctuation, multiple short sentences, clause boundaries)
- Integration tests: 3 real audit documents (policies, risk registers, SOC2 reports)
- Manual review: 10 randomly sampled chunks from 100-file batch verify no mid-sentence splits

### R-002: Entity relationships broken across chunk boundaries (Score: 6)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Entity-aware chunking algorithm in Story 3.2: analyze entity mentions before chunking
- Prefer chunk splits between entities rather than within entity contexts
- Add "entity_context" metadata field for partial entities with "continued" and "partial" flags
- Maintain entity relationship graph across chunks using entity IDs from Story 2.2
- Test all 6 entity types: processes, risks, controls, regulations, policies, issues

**Owner:** DEV Team
**Timeline:** Sprint 1 Week 2
**Status:** Planned
**Verification:**
- Unit tests: 4 entity preservation scenarios (single entity, multiple entities, relationships, cross-references)
- Integration tests: 2 relationship preservation tests (Risk→Control mappings, cross-references)
- Manual review: Entity relationship validation on 20 audit documents with known entity patterns

### R-003: Chunking 100 documents exceeds 10-minute NFR-P1 requirement (Score: 6)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- Optimize spaCy sentence segmentation with batch processing (process multiple documents in spaCy pipeline)
- Reuse memory monitoring from Story 2.5.2.1: get_total_memory() to track memory usage
- spaCy model lazy-loading (Story 3.1) and global caching (first-use only, not per-document)
- Parallel chunking using multiprocessing for CPU-bound sentence segmentation
- Performance baseline: 14.57 files/min from Story 2.5.2.1 (already includes extract+normalize, chunking adds ~20% overhead)

**Owner:** DEV Team
**Timeline:** Sprint 1 Week 3
**Status:** Planned
**Verification:**
- Performance test: 100 mixed PDFs in <10 minutes (NFR-P1 validation)
- Memory test: chunking stays within 4GB limit (NFR-P2 revised from Story 2.5.2.1)
- CI: Weekly performance regression job from Story 2.5-4 catches degradation

### R-004: Output format inconsistencies prevent downstream RAG integration (Score: 6)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- JSON schema validation in Story 3.4: define schema, validate all outputs against schema
- CSV escaping tests in Story 3.6: handle commas, quotes, newlines using Python csv.QUOTE_ALL
- TXT delimiter verification in Story 3.5: configurable delimiter (default: ━━━ CHUNK N ━━━)
- UTF-8 encoding validation across all formats (no mojibake or encoding errors)
- Integration tests: parse JSON with standard parser, import CSV to Excel/pandas, upload TXT to ChatGPT

**Owner:** QA Team
**Timeline:** Sprint 2 Week 1
**Status:** Planned
**Verification:**
- Unit tests: 3 JSON schema validation scenarios (valid schema, invalid content, special characters)
- Integration tests: 3 CSV import tests (Excel, pandas, Google Sheets)
- Integration tests: 3 TXT format tests (delimiter parsing, metadata headers, UTF-8 encoding)
- Manual validation: Upload TXT output to ChatGPT, verify no parsing errors

## Assumptions and Dependencies

### Assumptions

1. Epic 2 (Extract & Normalize) complete with high-quality normalized text ready for chunking
2. spaCy en_core_web_md model (43MB) pre-downloaded in development and cached in CI (Story 2.5-4)
3. Performance baselines from Story 2.5.2.1 remain valid: 14.57 files/min, 4.15GB memory
4. Entity normalization from Story 2.2 provides consistent entity tags in metadata
5. Test fixtures from Story 2.5.1 (100-file batch) available for chunking tests
6. Audit documents use standard English (textstat readability metrics designed for English)

### Dependencies

1. **Epic 2 Complete** - Required by Sprint 1 Day 1
   - Normalized text with entity tags (Story 2.2)
   - Quality validation and flagging (Story 2.4-2.5)
   - Metadata enrichment framework (Story 2.6)

2. **spaCy Integration** - Required by Sprint 1 Day 1
   - Story 2.5.2 spaCy integration complete (en_core_web_md model)
   - docs/troubleshooting-spacy.md available for setup guidance

3. **Performance Infrastructure** - Required by Sprint 1 Week 3
   - Story 2.5.2.1 memory monitoring (get_total_memory() function)
   - Story 2.5-4 CI/CD enhancements (spaCy caching, performance regression monitoring)

4. **Test Infrastructure** - Required by Sprint 1 Day 1
   - Story 1.3 testing framework (pytest, fixtures, markers)
   - 100-file performance batch from Story 2.5.1

### Risks to Plan

- **Risk**: spaCy sentence segmentation slower than expected on technical audit documents
  - **Impact**: May not meet NFR-P1 10-minute threshold for 100 files
  - **Contingency**: Fall back to simpler regex-based sentence splitting with lower accuracy but faster performance; document trade-off

- **Risk**: Entity-aware chunking algorithm too complex to implement in Sprint 1 Week 2
  - **Impact**: May defer entity relationship preservation to Epic 4 (advanced features)
  - **Contingency**: Implement basic entity-aware chunking (keep entities within chunks) in Epic 3, defer relationship graph to Epic 4

- **Risk**: Large document streaming (>100MB) reveals memory leaks in spaCy or chunking logic
  - **Impact**: May violate NFR-P2 4GB memory limit
  - **Contingency**: Document limit (e.g., max 50MB per file), provide guidance to split large PDFs before processing

### Testing Patterns from Epic 2

**Quality Gates (Epic 2 Lessons)**:
- Run quality gates (Black, Ruff, Mypy) BEFORE committing (shift-left)
- 0 violations required - no exceptions
- Pre-commit hooks validated in CI (Story 2.5-4 AC-5)

**Integration Testing (Epic 2 Lessons)**:
- Unit tests alone miss memory leaks and NFR violations
- Always test multi-component workflows with real data
- Use 100-file performance batch for realistic validation

**Performance Monitoring (Epic 2 Lessons)**:
- Profile first, establish baseline, then optimize
- Don't guess at bottlenecks - measure actual behavior
- Reuse get_total_memory() from Story 2.5.2.1 for memory tracking
- CI performance regression monitoring (Story 2.5-4 AC-1)

**spaCy Integration (Epic 2 Lessons)**:
- Download models via setup, not runtime (Story 2.5.2)
- Lazy-load on first use, cache globally
- CI caching saves 2-3 minutes per run (Story 2.5-4 AC-2)
- See docs/troubleshooting-spacy.md for setup guidance

### Test Execution Strategy

**Unit Tests (Fast Feedback)**:
- Focus on chunking logic, metadata enrichment, output formatting
- No spaCy model loading (mock sentence segmentation for speed)
- Edge cases: long sentences, empty docs, special characters
- Target: <5 min for all unit tests

**Integration Tests (Component Boundaries)**:
- spaCy sentence segmentation with real model
- End-to-end chunking: normalized text → chunks → outputs
- Real audit documents: policies, risk registers, SOC2 reports
- Target: <30 min for all integration tests

**Performance Tests (NFR Validation)**:
- 100-file batch: validate NFR-P1 (<10 min) and NFR-P2 (<4GB memory)
- Large file streaming: >100MB PDFs with memory monitoring
- Weekly CI job (Story 2.5-4 performance-regression.yml)
- Target: <10 min for performance suite

**Markers for Selective Execution**:
```bash
pytest -m unit                # Unit tests only (~5 min)
pytest -m integration         # Integration tests only (~30 min)
pytest -m performance         # Performance tests only (~10 min)
pytest -m chunking            # All Epic 3 chunking tests
pytest -m "not slow"          # Skip slow tests (development)
```
