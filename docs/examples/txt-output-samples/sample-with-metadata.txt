This is a sample document demonstrating metadata headers. The compact header provides traceability (source file), context (entity IDs), and quality scoring for filtering.

Metadata headers are limited to 1-3 lines to avoid clutter while providing essential context for LLM understanding.

This chunk shows graceful handling of missing metadata. The Entities line is omitted when no entity tags are present.

Quality scores enable downstream filtering (e.g., only include chunks with quality >0.90).
