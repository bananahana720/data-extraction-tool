=== SECTION 001 ===
This sample demonstrates custom delimiter patterns. The delimiter parameter accepts any string with {{n}} as the chunk number placeholder.

Custom delimiters are useful for domain-specific workflows or branding requirements.

=== SECTION 002 ===
The chunk numbering remains sequential (001, 002, 003...) regardless of delimiter pattern.

All other features (text cleaning, metadata headers, encoding) work identically with custom delimiters.
