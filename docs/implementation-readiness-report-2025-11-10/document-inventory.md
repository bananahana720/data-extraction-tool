## Document Analysis Summary

### PRD Analysis (docs/PRD.md)

**Scope & Vision:**
- **Product Type:** CLI tool for batch processing audit documents into RAG-optimized outputs
- **Core Problem:** "Garbage in, garbage out" for enterprise Gen AI - preventing AI hallucinations through knowledge quality
- **Target User:** AI power user in F100 cybersecurity internal audit, intermediate skill level
- **Domain:** Highly structured audit entities (processes, risks, controls, regulations, policies, issues)

**Success Criteria (Well-Defined):**
- Primary: RAG retrieval quality, OCR completeness (>95%), hallucination elimination, entity preservation
- Technical: Universal format handling, RAG optimization quality, batch processing reliability
- Secondary: Consistent personal use, configuration/automation, learning semantic analysis

**Product Scope (Clear MVP Definition):**
- **Brownfield Context:** Foundational extraction exists, MVP completes the pipeline
- **MVP Adds:** Robust normalization, CLI UX improvements, structured output formats (JSON/TXT/CSV), foundational semantic processing (TF-IDF, LSA, similarity)
- **Growth Features:** Word2Vec, LDA, custom NER, knowledge graphs
- **Vision:** GUI wrapper, advanced intelligence, enterprise integration

**Functional Requirements (Comprehensive - 8 FR Categories):**
- FR-1: Document extraction & text processing (universal formats, OCR, completeness validation)
- FR-2: Text normalization & cleaning (artifact removal, entity normalization, schema standardization)
- FR-3: Intelligent chunking (semantic boundaries, entity-aware, multiple output formats)
- FR-4: Quality assessment & validation (readability metrics, quality flagging, validation reporting)
- FR-5: Foundational semantic analysis (TF-IDF, similarity, LSA, quality metrics)
- FR-6: Batch processing & automation (batch files, graceful errors, config management, incremental)
- FR-7: CLI user interface (pipeline-style, progress feedback, summary stats, presets)
- FR-8: Output organization & export (flexible organization, metadata persistence, logging/audit trail)

**Non-Functional Requirements (Strong Emphasis):**
- Performance: 100 files in <10 min, 2GB max memory
- Security: On-premise only, no external APIs, no transformer models (enterprise constraint)
- Reliability: Deterministic processing (audit trail), graceful degradation, no silent failures
- Maintainability: Code clarity, documentation, modularity, testability
- Usability: Learning curve, error messages, discoverability, consistency
- Compatibility: Python 3.12 (required), Windows primary, offline operation
- Auditability: Processing traceability, logging, versioning, reproducibility

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Extremely comprehensive and well-structured
- ✅ Clear brownfield context and existing foundation
- ✅ Strong domain requirements (6 audit entity types)
- ✅ Measurable success criteria
- ✅ Technology stack already researched and recommended
- ✅ Phased scope (MVP → Growth → Vision)

**Observations:**
- Heavy emphasis on quality, determinism, and audit trail (appropriate for domain)
- CLI-first approach with clear rationale
- Enterprise constraints well-documented (Python 3.12, no transformers, on-premise)

### Architecture Analysis (docs/architecture.md)

**Architecture Philosophy:**
- Modular pipeline-composable processing (extract → normalize → chunk → analyze → output)
- Streaming, memory-efficient design
- Determinism for audit trail compliance
- Clarity and maintainability for learning

**Project Structure:**
- Modern src/ layout with pipeline modules
- Clear separation: extract/, normalize/, chunk/, semantic/, output/, core/, config/, utils/
- Comprehensive testing structure mirroring src/
- Well-organized with clear responsibilities

**Decision Summary (59 Architecture Decisions Documented):**
- CLI Framework: Typer 0.12.x (type-safe, less boilerplate)
- Terminal UI: Rich 13.x (progress bars, tables)
- NLP Core: spaCy 3.7.x (en_core_web_md)
- Vectorization: scikit-learn 1.5.x (TF-IDF, LSA)
- Topic Modeling: gensim 4.3.x (Word2Vec, LDA)
- Document Extraction: PyMuPDF, python-docx, pytesseract, openpyxl
- Data Models: Pydantic 2.x (validation)
- Configuration: PyYAML + env vars (3-tier cascade)
- Testing: pytest 8.x + coverage
- Code Quality: ruff + mypy + black
- Logging: structlog (JSON output for audit trail)

**Implementation Patterns (Well-Defined):**
- Pipeline Stage Pattern (all stages implement common interface)
- Error Handling Pattern (ProcessingError vs CriticalError, continue-on-error)
- Logging Pattern (structured logging with context)
- Configuration Cascade Pattern (CLI > env > YAML > defaults)
- Consistent naming conventions and code organization rules

**Consistency Rules:**
- Clear naming conventions (files, classes, functions, CLI commands, outputs)
- Standard code organization (imports, class structure, testing)
- Error handling guidelines (specific exceptions, actionable messages, no silent failures)
- Logging strategy (levels, structured format, audit trail)

**Data Architecture:**
- Core models: Entity, Metadata, Document, Chunk, ProcessingResult (Pydantic)
- Six audit entity types with relationship preservation
- File-based storage (no database) - manifests, configs, logs, caches
- SHA-256 hashing for change detection and incremental processing

**Security & Performance:**
- On-premise processing (no external calls)
- Input validation and safe handling
- Target: 100 files in <10 min, 2GB max memory
- Optimization: Parallel processing, lazy loading, sparse matrices, streaming

**Architecture Decision Records (6 ADRs):**
- ADR-001: Typer over Click
- ADR-002: Pydantic over dataclasses
- ADR-003: File-based storage (no database)
- ADR-004: Classical NLP only (enterprise constraint)
- ADR-005: Streaming pipeline (not batch-load)
- ADR-006: Continue-on-error batch processing

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Comprehensive and production-ready architecture
- ✅ Clear implementation patterns for AI agents
- ✅ Strong emphasis on determinism, audit trail, and quality
- ✅ All technology choices justified with rationale
- ✅ Brownfield integration considered
- ✅ Excellent consistency rules and coding standards

**Observations:**
- Architecture is significantly more detailed than typical - excellent for agent execution
- Strong focus on maintainability and learning (appropriate for intermediate user)
- Realistic brownfield approach (refactor existing, not rebuild)
