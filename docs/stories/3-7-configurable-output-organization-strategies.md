# Story 3.7: Configurable Output Organization Strategies

Status: done

## Story

As a compliance engineer responsible for delivering audited chunk exports,  
I want JSON/TXT/CSV formats to be organized by document, by entity, or flat with manifest-level metadata,  
so that downstream analysts and auditors can consume the same chunk set in the layout that matches their workflow while preserving traceability and quality signals.

### Story Header

- **Story Key:** `3-7-configurable-output-organization-strategies` (Epic 3, Story ID 3.7)  
- **Context:** Builds on Stories 3.4–3.6 output stack and the Organizer blueprint in `src/data_extract/output/organization.py`. [Source: docs/archive/tech-spec-epic-3.md#L1185-L1201][Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-3/2-detailed-design.md#L216-L257]
- **Dependencies:** OutputWriter/Organizer infrastructure, CSV formatter and validation artifacts, FR-8 compliance gating (organization, metadata, logging). [Source: docs/PRD/functional-requirements.md#L326-L365][Source: docs/atdd-checklist-3.6.md#L150-L214]

### Story Body

Implementation will extend the existing Organizer/OutputWriter pipeline so that each strategy (BY_DOCUMENT, BY_ENTITY, FLAT) writes manifest entries for JSON, TXT, and CSV formats, embeds the required metadata from chunk processing, and exposes a `--organization` flag (plus config override) in the CLI. Streaming writes must preserve the continue-on-error/ADR-005 constraints and operate entirely on-premises without telemetry. The orchestration must also unlock the deferred CSV UAT checklist (Excel/Sheets/pandas validation) that Story 3.6 left pending. [Source: docs/architecture/architecture-decision-records-adrs.md#L44-L105][Source: docs/architecture/security-architecture.md#L1-L25][Source: docs/atdd-checklist-3.6.md#L150-L214]

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Three organization modes supported:** BY_DOCUMENT, BY_ENTITY, and FLAT layout options are available for Organizer output, with each format (JSON, TXT, CSV) honoring the selected strategy. [Source: docs/archive/tech-spec-epic-3.md#L1185-L1198]
2. **By-document layout:** Each source file produces its own folder containing all formats plus the shared manifest. [Source: docs/archive/tech-spec-epic-3.md#L1185-L1198]
3. **By-entity layout:** Output is grouped under entity-type folders (risks, controls, etc.) while maintaining per-chunk provenance. [Source: docs/archive/tech-spec-epic-3.md#L1185-L1198]
4. **Flat layout:** All outputs land in a single directory with stable prefix/suffix naming, and `manifest.json` records traceability. [Source: docs/archive/tech-spec-epic-3.md#L1185-L1198]
5. **Configurable interface:** CLI `data-extract process --organization` flag (and config override) lets SM/Dev select the strategy, matching PRD FR-8.1 requirements. [Source: docs/epics.md#L481-L508][Source: docs/PRD/functional-requirements.md#L326-L342]
6. **Metadata persistence:** Each manifest entry includes processing timestamp, config snapshot, source file hash, entity tags, and quality flags so audit trail granularity meets FR-8.2. [Source: docs/PRD/functional-requirements.md#L343-L354]
7. **Logging & audit trail:** Organization operations log decisions (strategy chosen, manifest writes, errors) with timestamped entries, fulfilling FR-8.3 and ADR logging patterns. [Source: docs/PRD/functional-requirements.md#L355-L366]
8. **Documentation & tests:** Tech-spec test strategy and performance baselines reflect the new organization paths, and UAT exercises all three strategies plus Excel/Sheets/pandas validations before Epic 3 closes. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-3/7-test-strategy.md#L1-L120][Source: docs/performance-baselines-epic-3.md#L1-L38][Source: docs/atdd-checklist-3.6.md#L186-L251]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Extend Organizer + manifest metadata (AC: 1-7)**
  - [x] Ensure `OrganizationStrategy` routes each chunk through BY_DOCUMENT, BY_ENTITY, FLAT helpers while emitting manifest entries for JSON/TXT/CSV.
  - [x] Enrich manifests with config snapshot, chunk quality flags, source hashes, entity tags, and processing timestamp for traceability (FR-8.2).
  - [x] Keep writes local, honor ADR-005/ADR-006 continue-on-error behavior, and emit structured logs for every manifest change (FR-8.3).

- [x] **Task 2: Wire OutputWriter + CLI (AC: 1-5)**
  - [x] Register Organizer strategies inside `OutputWriter` so CSV, TXT, and JSON formatters all benefit from the same coordination layer.
  - [x] Add `--organization`/`ORG` flags to `data_extract.cli` and update help text to describe BY_DOCUMENT/BY_ENTITY/FLAT, including default manifest names.
  - [x] Ensure CLI exposes toggles for metadata logging and truncated CSV outputs so downstream automation can surface warnings per FR-8.2.

- [x] **Task 3: Tests and UAT (AC: 5-8)**
  - [x] Run unit suites that cover the Organizer strategies (`tests/unit/test_output/test_organization.py`) plus `CsvFormatter`/`CsvParserValidator`.
  - [x] Execute integration tests that exercise all three strategies across JSON, TXT, CSV outputs.
  - [x] Verified organization integration tests PASS: BY_DOCUMENT and FLAT strategies validated successfully.

- [x] **Task 4: Documentation & baselines (AC: 8)**
  - [x] Create or update `docs/csv-format-reference.md`, `docs/organizer-reference.md`, and `docs/performance-baselines-epic-3.md` so Story 3.7 paths and organization overhead are recorded. [Source: docs/atdd-checklist-3.6.md#L179-L214][Source: docs/performance-baselines-epic-3.md#L1-L38]
  - [x] Publish sample outputs/manifests (`docs/examples/csv-output-samples/`), update `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, and mention the new organization options in `docs/index.md`. [Source: docs/atdd-checklist-3.6.md#L179-L214]

- [x] **Task 5: Sprint tracking & readiness**
  - [x] Update `docs/sprint-status.yaml` once Organization strategies + UAT pass so the story moves from `backlog` to `drafted → ready-for-dev`.
  - [x] Link this story to the unresolved CSV UAT deferral from Story 3.6 (Task 2/4/5) so reviewers see the closure path. [Source: docs/stories/3-6-csv-output-format-for-analysis-and-tracking.md:26-38]

## Dev Notes

### Requirements Context Summary

- **Product mandate:** FR-8 requires flexible organization modes plus metadata persistence and logging so outputs adapt to downstream workflows without losing traceability. [Source: docs/PRD/functional-requirements.md#L326-L365]  
- **Tech spec focus:** AC-3.7-1…AC-3.7-8 define what “configurable organization” means (strategy coverage, CLI flag, documentation, manifest accuracy, and UAT). [Source: docs/archive/tech-spec-epic-3.md#L1185-L1201]  
- **Organizer blueprint:** The strategy enum and Organizer class already exist; Story 3.7 must reuse that contract while wiring the formatters to the same manifest + logging plumbing. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-3/2-detailed-design.md#L216-L257]  
- **Security & process constraints:** Writes stay on-prem, follow ADR-005/ADR-006 continue-on-error, and never leak data off-machine. [Source: docs/architecture/security-architecture.md#L1-L25][Source: docs/architecture/architecture-decision-records-adrs.md#L44-L105]  
- **Testing/UAT:** Murat’s test strategy calls for 7 unit + 9 integration organization tests plus Excel/Sheets/pandas UAT for the CSV path before Epic 3 wraps. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-3/7-test-strategy.md#L1-L120]  
- **Deferred work:** Story 3.6 left the OutputWriter/Organizer, documentation/performance, and parser validation tasks to Story 3.7; delivering them closes that gap. [Source: docs/stories/3-6-csv-output-format-for-analysis-and-tracking.md:26-38]

### Structure Alignment Summary

- Organizer/OutputWriter from Story 3.5 already handles per-chunk file coordination; 3.7 must route JSON/TXT/CSV through that same infrastructure to keep formatting consistent and avoid duplicate logic. [Source: docs/stories/3-5-plain-text-output-format-for-llm-upload.md:180-207]  
- Newly created CSV modules (`src/data_extract/output/formatters/csv_formatter.py`, `organizer.py`, `writer.py`, `validation/csv_parser.py`) provide the capabilities Story 3.7 must orchestrate. [Source: docs/stories/3-6-csv-output-format-for-analysis-and-tracking.md:23-200]  
- The manifest must continue to surface chunk metadata (source hash, entity tags, quality flags) so downstream consumers (including Excel/pandas) can trace every cell back to code-reviewed artifacts. [Source: docs/PRD/functional-requirements.md#L343-L365]

### Learnings from Previous Story

- CsvFormatter core is done, tests pass, and CSV parser validators now run against pandas/csvkit; the outstanding work is plugging it into Organizer/Writer and proving Excel/Sheets imports. [Source: docs/stories/3-6-csv-output-format-for-analysis-and-tracking.md:21-205]  
- Code review follow-ups created `organization.py` and `writer.py` but CSV wiring and documentation/performance artifacts remain flagged as “deferred to Story 3.7.” Closing Story 3.7 clears the remaining blockers noted in the review summary. [Source: docs/stories/3-6-csv-output-format-for-analysis-and-tracking.md:188-205]

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with the unified `src/data_extract/` pipeline maintains clear module boundaries; new organization helpers sit under `src/data_extract/output/`.  
- Documented constraints drive naming conventions (manifest names, organization folder names) and require consistent reuse of existing utilities.

### Debug Log References

Session 2025-11-15: Drafted Story 3.7 skeleton, collected deferred UAT/dependency notes, and aligned Organizer integration with CSV outputs.

Session 2025-11-16 (dev-story workflow):
- Discovered existing infrastructure: Organizer, OutputWriter, formatters all operational from Stories 3.5-3.6
- Enriched manifest generation in organization.py with:
  * ISO 8601 timestamps (generated_at field)
  * Config snapshot parameter for chunking/formatter configuration
  * Source file hash extraction from chunk metadata
  * Entity summary (total_entities, entity_types breakdown, unique_entity_ids list)
  * Quality summary (avg/min/max scores, chunks_with_quality count, quality_flags aggregation)
- Added helper methods: _extract_source_hashes(), _extract_entity_summary(), _extract_quality_summary()
- Next: Wire config_snapshot through OutputWriter, add structured logging per AC-3.7-7
