# Story 2.5: Completeness Validation and Gap Detection

Status: review

## Story

As an audit professional,
I want to detect and flag incomplete extractions or missing content,
so that I can trust all critical information is captured (no silent data loss).

## Context Summary

**Epic Context:** Story 2.5 is part of Epic 2 (Extract & Normalize), focusing on data quality validation to ensure no content silently disappears during extraction. This story builds on the OCR confidence validation from Story 2.4 by adding completeness checking for extraction gaps.

**Business Value:** Addresses critical data integrity requirements by ensuring no content silently disappears during extraction, with complete audit trail visibility into what was skipped and why.

**Dependencies:**
- **Story 2.1** (Text Cleaning) - Provides cleaned ContentBlocks for analysis
- **Story 2.4** (OCR Confidence Validation) - OCR metadata used for detection; QualityValidator class and ValidationReport model established

**Technical Foundation:**
- ValidationReport model exists (Story 2.4) with fields: `quarantine_recommended`, `quality_flags`, `extraction_gaps`
- QualityFlag enum exists with `MISSING_IMAGES`, `INCOMPLETE_EXTRACTION` values
- Metadata model has `quality_flags: List[str]` field
- QualityValidator class exists at `src/data_extract/normalize/validation.py` - extend with completeness checking methods

**Key Requirements from Tech Spec:**
1. Detect images without alt text → flag as `MISSING_IMAGES`
2. Detect complex objects (OLE, charts, diagrams) that can't be extracted
3. Calculate extraction completeness ratio: `extracted_elements / total_elements`
4. Log content gaps with specific locations (page number, section name)
5. No silent failures - all issues surfaced in validation report
6. Actionable explanations for what was skipped and why
7. Flagged documents marked in output metadata

**Completeness Threshold:** 0.90 (90% - configurable via `NormalizationConfig.completeness_threshold`)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC-2.5.1:** Images without alt text are detected and flagged (`QualityFlag.MISSING_IMAGES`)
2. **AC-2.5.2:** Complex objects that can't be extracted are reported (OLE objects, charts, diagrams)
3. **AC-2.5.3:** Extraction completeness ratio is calculated (`extracted_elements / total_elements`)
4. **AC-2.5.4:** Content gaps are logged with specific locations (page number, section name)
5. **AC-2.5.5:** No silent failures occur - all issues are surfaced in validation report
6. **AC-2.5.6:** Validation report identifies what was skipped and why (actionable explanations)
7. **AC-2.5.7:** Flagged documents are marked in output metadata (`QualityFlag` enum values)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**PipelineStage Pattern:** QualityValidator implements `PipelineStage[Document, Document]` protocol - extend existing class from Story 2.4, don't create new validator.

**Data Model Immutability:** Use `model_copy()` when modifying Document or Metadata (frozen dataclasses). Never mutate in-place.

**Error Handling (ADR-006):** Raise `ValidationError` (recoverable) for validation failures, not `CriticalError`. Continue batch processing on single document failures.

**Configuration Cascade:** CLI flags > Environment variables (`DATA_EXTRACT_COMPLETENESS_THRESHOLD`) > YAML config > NormalizationConfig defaults.

**Graceful Degradation:** If validation fails (e.g., missing source metadata), log warning and continue with partial results. Never silently drop documents.

**Logging Pattern:** Use structlog with structured JSON fields for audit trail. Include: file path, metric values, thresholds, actions taken.

**Testing Standards (CRITICAL from Story 2.3):** Always run Black/Ruff/Mypy BEFORE marking tasks complete. Target >85% coverage initially, aim for 100%.

### Source Tree Components to Touch

**Extend Existing Files:**
- `src/data_extract/core/models.py` - Add completeness fields to Metadata, extend QualityFlag enum, extend ValidationReport
- `src/data_extract/normalize/config.py` - Add completeness_threshold to NormalizationConfig
- `src/data_extract/normalize/validation.py` - Extend QualityValidator with completeness methods
- `src/data_extract/normalize/normalizer.py` - QualityValidator already integrated at Step 4, ensure completeness validation called

**Test Files:**
- `tests/unit/core/test_models.py` - Add tests for Metadata.completeness_ratio and extended ValidationReport
- `tests/unit/test_normalize/test_validation.py` - Add 40+ tests for completeness validation methods
- `tests/integration/` - Add end-to-end completeness validation tests (optional, low priority)

**Configuration:**
- `config/normalize/validation.yaml` (if created) - Add completeness_threshold, detect_missing_images, detect_complex_objects flags

### Testing Standards Summary

**Unit Test Organization (by AC):**
- TestMissingImagesDetection (8+ tests for AC-2.5.1)
- TestComplexObjectsDetection (8+ tests for AC-2.5.2)
- TestCompletenessRatioCalculation (10+ tests for AC-2.5.3)
- TestGapLogging (5+ tests for AC-2.5.4)
- TestNoSilentFailures (5+ tests for AC-2.5.5)
- TestValidationReportGeneration (5+ tests for AC-2.5.6)
- TestMetadataEnrichment (4+ tests for AC-2.5.7)

**Coverage Target:** >85% for validation.py completeness methods, aim for 100%

**Test Fixtures Required:**
- Document with missing images (no alt text)
- Document with complex objects (OLE, charts, diagrams)
- Document with low completeness ratio (<0.85)
- Document with 100% completeness (baseline)
- Mixed document (some gaps, some complete)

**Quality Gates:**
- Black formatting: 100 char line length
- Ruff linting: 0 errors
- Mypy strict mode: 0 errors for src/data_extract/
- All tests passing: 0 failures
- No brownfield regressions: existing 1000+ tests still pass

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**
- Validation logic in `src/data_extract/normalize/validation.py` (established in Story 2.4)
- Data models in `src/data_extract/core/models.py` (centralized)
- Tests mirror source structure: `tests/unit/test_normalize/test_validation.py`
- Configuration in `src/data_extract/normalize/config.py` (established pattern)

**No Conflicts Detected:** Story 2.5 extends existing validation infrastructure without structural changes.

### Learnings from Previous Story (Story 2.4)

**From Story 2.4 (Status: done, Approved)**

**Services to Reuse (DO NOT Recreate):**
- **QualityValidator class** at `src/data_extract/normalize/validation.py` (592 lines) - EXTEND this class with completeness methods
  - Use `validate_ocr_confidence()` method for OCR scoring (already implemented)
  - Use `create_validation_report()` method pattern for generating reports
  - Use `quarantine_document()` method if completeness < 0.85 (critical threshold)
- **ValidationReport model** - Already has `extraction_gaps: List[str]` and `quarantine_recommended: bool` fields
- **QualityFlag enum** - Already has `MISSING_IMAGES` and `INCOMPLETE_EXTRACTION` values, add `COMPLEX_OBJECTS`
- **Metadata.quality_flags** field - Store completeness flags here

**Architectural Patterns Established:**
- **PipelineStage protocol** - QualityValidator integrated at Step 4 in Normalizer pipeline
- **Configuration cascade** - ocr_confidence_threshold pattern → follow for completeness_threshold
- **Graceful degradation** - Tesseract missing → log warning, continue → apply same for validation failures
- **Audit trail pattern** - JSON logging with file hash, confidence scores, timestamps → extend for completeness

**New Files Created in Story 2.4:**
- `src/data_extract/normalize/validation.py` - Extend this file (don't create new one)
- `tests/unit/test_normalize/test_validation.py` - Add more test classes here

**Modified Files in Story 2.4:**
- `src/data_extract/core/models.py` - Extend QualityFlag, ValidationReport, Metadata (add completeness fields)
- `src/data_extract/normalize/config.py` - Add completeness_threshold field
- `src/data_extract/normalize/normalizer.py` - QualityValidator already wired, ensure completeness methods called

**Technical Debt from Story 2.4 (NOT blocking):**
- Pre-existing Mypy error in `pipeline.py:93` - "Missing type parameters" (defer to future story)

**Critical Testing Standards:**
- Run Black/Ruff/Mypy BEFORE marking tasks complete (Story 2.3/2.4 lesson)
- Target >85% coverage, aim for 100% (Story 2.4 achieved 93 tests passing)
- Test edge cases: boundary values (exactly 0.90 threshold), missing dependencies, division by zero
- Mock external dependencies for deterministic results

**Code Quality Patterns:**
- Black formatting with 100 char lines
- Ruff linting (0 errors required)
- Mypy strict mode for new code
- Comprehensive docstrings with Google style
- Type hints on all public functions

**Data Model Safety:**
- Only add new fields to existing models (don't modify existing)
- Use `model_copy()` for immutability (frozen dataclasses)
- Validate all new fields via Pydantic (e.g., completeness_ratio: 0.0-1.0 range)
- Use Union types for backwards compatibility if needed

**Quarantine Pattern from Story 2.4:**
- Use `quarantine_document()` method if `completeness_ratio < 0.85` (critical threshold)
- JSON audit log with file metadata, quality metrics, decision context
- Append-mode logging with corruption recovery

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** andrew  
**Date:** 2025-11-11  
**Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

### Outcome: BLOCKED

**Justification:** Task 8 falsely marked complete - quality gates NOT passed. Ruff has 1 violation, Mypy has 6 violations. Marking quality gates as passed when they failed undermines code quality standards.

### Summary

Story 2.5 implements completeness validation with ALL 7 acceptance criteria technically satisfied. Implementation adds detect_missing_images(), detect_complex_objects(), calculate_completeness_ratio(), and log_extraction_gap() methods. Data models properly extended. 33 tests written and passing. However, quality gates (Ruff, Mypy) were NOT passed as claimed in Task 8.

### Key Findings

**HIGH SEVERITY BLOCKERS:**

**H-1: Task 8 Falsely Marked Complete**
- Task claims "0 violations" for Ruff and Mypy but both failed
- Actual: Ruff 1 violation (unused variable line 697), Mypy 6 violations (missing named arguments lines 694, 719, 736)
- Files: src/data_extract/normalize/validation.py

**H-2: Mypy Type Violations**
- ValidationReport() instantiated without required Optional fields in 3 locations
- Missing: document_average_confidence=None, scanned_pdf_detected=None
- Lines: validation.py:694, 719, 736

**MEDIUM SEVERITY:**

**M-1: Ruff Linting Violation**
- Unused variable ocr_validation_performed at line 697
- Dead code violation F841

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

**Summary:** 7 of 7 FULLY IMPLEMENTED

| AC | Status | Evidence |
|----|--------|----------|
| AC-2.5.1 | IMPLEMENTED | validation.py:493, 6 tests pass |
| AC-2.5.2 | IMPLEMENTED | validation.py:541, 4 tests pass |
| AC-2.5.3 | IMPLEMENTED | validation.py:586, models.py:164-169, 4 tests |
| AC-2.5.4 | IMPLEMENTED | validation.py:615, 2 tests pass |
| AC-2.5.5 | IMPLEMENTED | Quarantine threshold, 2 integration tests |
| AC-2.5.6 | IMPLEMENTED | Actionable gap descriptions verified |
| AC-2.5.7 | IMPLEMENTED | QualityFlag.COMPLEX_OBJECTS at models.py:79 |

### Task Completion Validation

**Summary:** 8 of 9 VERIFIED, 1 FALSE COMPLETION

| Task | Verified | Evidence |
|------|----------|----------|
| Task 1 | VERIFIED | Models extended, 16 tests pass |
| Task 2 | VERIFIED | detect_missing_images(), 6 tests |
| Task 3 | VERIFIED | detect_complex_objects(), 4 tests |
| Task 4 | VERIFIED | calculate_completeness_ratio(), 4 tests |
| Task 5 | VERIFIED | log_extraction_gap(), 2 tests |
| Task 6 | VERIFIED | No silent failures, 2 integration tests |
| Task 7 | VERIFIED | Pipeline integration normalizer.py:228-244 |
| Task 8 | FALSE | Tests pass BUT quality gates failed |
| Task 9 | VERIFIED | Documentation updated |

### Test Coverage

- New Tests: 33 (17 completeness + 16 model)
- Results: 61/61 passing (33 new + 44 existing)
- Quality: Excellent edge case coverage
- Regressions: None

### Architectural Alignment

All patterns correctly followed:
- PipelineStage Protocol: validation.py integrated at normalizer.py:228-244
- Immutability: model_copy() used (lines 769, 794, 810, 866)
- Error Handling: ProcessingError pattern followed
- Configuration Cascade: completeness_threshold at config.py:123-128
- Structured Logging: Proper structlog usage

### Security Notes

No concerns identified. Input validation, proper exception handling, no PII in logs.

### Action Items

**BLOCKERS:**

- [ ] [High] Fix Mypy violations - Add document_average_confidence=None, scanned_pdf_detected=None to ValidationReport() calls at lines 694, 719, 736
- [ ] [Med] Remove unused variable ocr_validation_performed at line 697
- [ ] [High] Re-run quality gates and verify 0 violations, update Task 8 with proof

**ADVISORY:**

- Note: Excellent test coverage and architecture patterns
- Note: validation.py untracked in git - ensure committed
- Note: Consider performance tests for large documents in future

### Final Verdict

BLOCKED - Fix 7 quality gate violations (6 Mypy + 1 Ruff), verify passes, update Task 8 proof, then re-review.

**What's Good:** All ACs implemented, 61 tests passing, architecture correct, no security issues  
**What Blocks:** Quality gates failed but Task 8 claims passed - unacceptable false completion

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix violations (5 minutes)
2. Verify gates pass (1 minute)
3. Update Task 8 with proof (1 minute)
4. Re-request review
