## Recommendations
1. Must Fix: Implement CSV OutputWriter/CLI integration and add real pandas/csvkit validation so AC-3.6-4/7 can pass.
2. Should Improve: Produce Excel/Sheets UAT artifacts and documentation once the above infrastructure exists.
3. Consider: Expand automated coverage once the pipeline wiring is in place (integration tests should stop skipping).
