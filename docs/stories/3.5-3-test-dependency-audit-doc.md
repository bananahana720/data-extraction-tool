# Story 3.5.3: Test Dependency Audit Documentation

Status: backlog

## Story

As a developer preparing for a new epic with unfamiliar libraries,
I want a documented test-dependency audit process with automated checklist hooks,
so that environment/tool readiness is validated systematically instead of relying on tribal knowledge.

### Story Header

- **Story Key:** `3.5-3-test-dependency-audit-doc` (Epic 3.5, Story ID 3.5.3)
- **Context:** Addresses Epic 3 retrospective finding that undocumented dependency audit process creates risk as semantic toolchain grows. [Source: docs/retrospectives/epic-3-retro-2025-11-16.md#L37-L39]
- **Dependencies:** Epic 2.5 spaCy integration examples (template for process doc)
- **Estimate:** 3 hours
- **Owner:** Winston

### Story Body

Implementation will create `docs/processes/test-dependency-audit.md` documenting the systematic process for validating new library dependencies before epic development starts. The doc will include a checklist template (library installation, smoke tests, CI cache configuration, performance baseline measurement, documentation updates) based on Epic 2.5's successful spaCy integration pattern. An automated pre-commit hook will link to this process doc when new dependencies are detected in `pyproject.toml`, ensuring developers follow the documented workflow. [Source: docs/retrospectives/epic-3-retro-2025-11-16.md#L50]

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Process doc exists:** `docs/processes/test-dependency-audit.md` committed with complete dependency audit workflow. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-3.5.md#L29-L30]
2. **Checklist template:** Doc includes step-by-step checklist covering library installation, smoke tests, CI caching, baselines, docs. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-3.5.md#L29-L30]
3. **Epic 2.5 examples:** References spaCy integration (Story 2.5.2) as concrete example of the process in action. [Source: docs/retrospectives/epic-3-retro-2025-11-16.md#L50]
4. **Automated hook:** Pre-commit hook detects `pyproject.toml` dependency changes and reminds developers to follow audit process. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-3.5.md#L29-L30]
5. **Story template integration:** Dependency audit checklist linked from story template wiring section (Story 3.5.1 coordination). [Source: docs/retrospectives/epic-3-retro-2025-11-16.md#L50]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Analyze Epic 2.5 spaCy integration (AC: 3)**
  - [ ] Review Story 2.5.2 implementation (spaCy model download, smoke tests, CI caching)
  - [ ] Extract reusable patterns from spaCy integration approach
  - [ ] Document lessons learned from that dependency addition
  - [ ] Identify common pitfalls to warn about in process doc

- [ ] **Task 2: Write dependency audit process doc (AC: 1-2)**
  - [ ] Create `docs/processes/test-dependency-audit.md` structure
  - [ ] Document step-by-step checklist: installation, smoke tests, CI config, baselines, docs
  - [ ] Include spaCy integration as worked example
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting section for common dependency issues
  - [ ] Define when audit is required (new libraries, major version upgrades)

- [ ] **Task 3: Create automated hook (AC: 4)**
  - [ ] Create pre-commit hook that detects `pyproject.toml` changes
  - [ ] Hook outputs reminder to follow test-dependency-audit.md process
  - [ ] Add hook configuration to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
  - [ ] Test hook triggers on dependency additions/changes

- [ ] **Task 4: Integration and validation (AC: 5)**
  - [ ] Coordinate with Story 3.5.1 to link audit doc from story template wiring checklist
  - [ ] Validate doc is discoverable via `docs/processes/` directory
  - [ ] QA review for completeness and clarity

## Dev Notes

### Requirements Context Summary

- **Retrospective finding:** Dependency audit doc still absent (deferred from Epic 2, no owner); risk of future epics missing env/tool setup. [Source: docs/retrospectives/epic-3-retro-2025-11-16.md#L23-L24]
- **Significant discovery:** Undocumented dependency audit process means relying on tribal knowledge; unacceptable as semantic toolchain grows. [Source: docs/retrospectives/epic-3-retro-2025-11-16.md#L37-L39]
- **Action plan item #3:** Create test-dependency audit process doc + checklist hook by 2025-11-22 with Winston ownership. [Source: docs/retrospectives/epic-3-retro-2025-11-16.md#L50]

### Structure Alignment Summary

- Process doc follows existing `docs/processes/` directory structure (currently empty, this establishes the pattern).
- Epic 2.5.2 (spaCy integration) provides concrete example: model download, smoke tests, CI caching, performance validation.
- Hook extends existing pre-commit infrastructure for consistent enforcement.
