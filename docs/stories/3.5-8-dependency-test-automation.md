# Story 3.5.8: Dependency Auditor & Test Generator Automation

Status: drafted

## Story

As a developer working with complex test suites,
I want automated dependency auditing and test generation from story specifications,
So that test dependencies are always accurate and test coverage is comprehensive from the start.

### Story Header

- **Story Key:** `3.5-8-dependency-test-automation` (Epic 3.5, Story ID 3.5.8)
- **Context:** P1 priority scripts from automation recommendations to improve test infrastructure. [Source: docs/research/script-automation-recommendations.md#L61-L91]
- **Dependencies:** Story 3.5-1 (template generator must be complete)
- **Estimate:** 8 hours
- **Owner:** DevOps Team

### Story Body

Implementation will create two P1 automation scripts that enhance test infrastructure. The dependency auditor (`scripts/audit_dependencies.py`) will scan test files for imports, cross-reference with pyproject.toml, identify missing dependencies, and maintain accurate documentation. The test generator (`scripts/generate_tests.py`) will parse story markdown files to create test stubs for each acceptance criterion, generate fixture files with sample data, and add proper test markers. Both scripts will integrate with the existing testing framework and CI/CD pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Dependency Auditor (P1 Script 4)

1. **Import scanning:** Script scans all test files in `tests/` for import statements and extracts package dependencies. [Source: docs/research/script-automation-recommendations.md#L66]
2. **Cross-reference validation:** Compares discovered imports with dependencies in pyproject.toml [test] section. [Source: docs/research/script-automation-recommendations.md#L67]
3. **Missing dependency detection:** Identifies and reports packages used in tests but not declared in pyproject.toml. [Source: docs/research/script-automation-recommendations.md#L68]
4. **Report generation:** Creates dependency audit report in JSON/markdown format with recommendations. [Source: docs/research/script-automation-recommendations.md#L69]
5. **Documentation updates:** Automatically updates test dependency documentation in appropriate location. [Source: docs/research/script-automation-recommendations.md#L70]
6. **Performance optimization:** Caches dependency analysis for files that haven't changed (mtime-based). [Source: docs/research/script-automation-recommendations.md#L71]

### Test Generator (P1 Script 5)

7. **Story parsing:** Parses story markdown files to extract acceptance criteria using regex/markdown parser. [Source: docs/research/script-automation-recommendations.md#L80]
8. **Test stub generation:** Creates test file with one test function per AC, properly named and documented. [Source: docs/research/script-automation-recommendations.md#L81]
9. **Fixture creation:** Generates fixture files in `tests/fixtures/` with sample data structures based on story. [Source: docs/research/script-automation-recommendations.md#L82]
10. **Performance test templates:** Includes performance test template when NFR requirements detected in story. [Source: docs/research/script-automation-recommendations.md#L83]
11. **Test markers:** Adds appropriate pytest markers (unit, integration, etc.) based on AC type. [Source: docs/research/script-automation-recommendations.md#L84]

### Integration Requirements

12. **Pre-commit integration:** Both scripts integrate with pre-commit hooks for validation on commit.
13. **CI/CD integration:** Scripts run in CI pipeline to validate dependencies and test coverage.
14. **Quality gates:** All scripts pass black/ruff/mypy with 0 violations, >80% test coverage.

## Dev Notes

### Requirements Context Summary

- **Epic 3 retrospective finding:** Test dependencies not properly documented caused setup failures.
- **P1 priority:** Important for developer productivity but not blocking Epic 4.
- **Integration points:** Works with Story 3.5-1 template generator for seamless workflow.

### Implementation Notes

- Use AST module for reliable Python import parsing
- Consider using `pipreqs` or similar for dependency detection
- Cache analysis results to avoid re-scanning unchanged files
- Generate fixtures that follow existing patterns from Epic 3
