# Story: 4-3 Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) Implementation

## Story
**ID:** 4-3-latent-semantic-analysis-lsa-implementation
**Epic:** 4 - Knowledge Curation via Classical NLP
**Title:** Implement Latent Semantic Analysis for Dimensionality Reduction and Topic Extraction
**Priority:** P0
**Estimate:** 13 hours

As a data scientist analyzing large document collections, I want to reduce the dimensionality of TF-IDF vectors using LSA to extract latent topics and enable semantic clustering, so that I can group similar documents into coherent clusters and achieve 10x reduction in LLM processing costs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **AC-4.3-1:** LsaReductionStage implements PipelineStage protocol accepting ProcessingResult from similarity stage and returning enriched ProcessingResult
- [x] **AC-4.3-2:** TruncatedSVD reduces TF-IDF vectors to configurable components (default 100, range 50-300) preserving 80%+ variance
- [x] **AC-4.3-3:** Extract interpretable topics with top N terms per component (default top 10 terms)
- [x] **AC-4.3-4:** K-means clustering on LSA vectors achieves silhouette score ≥0.65 for document grouping
- [x] **AC-4.3-5:** Performance meets NFR: <300ms for 1000 documents, <3s for 10k documents, <500MB memory
- [x] **AC-4.3-6:** Cache LSA models and transformed vectors using content-based keys with joblib
- [x] **AC-4.3-7:** Output includes lsa_vectors, topics dict, clusters, explained_variance_ratio
- [x] **AC-4.3-8:** Deterministic results with fixed random_state=42 for SVD and clustering
- [x] **AC-4.3-9:** Support incremental/partial fit for streaming large corpora
- [x] **AC-4.3-10:** All code passes mypy with zero errors and black/ruff with zero violations

## Dev Notes

### Algorithm Details
- TruncatedSVD is more efficient than full SVD for sparse matrices
- Number of components is critical: too few loses information, too many overfits
- L2 normalization after SVD improves clustering performance
- Randomized algorithm faster for large matrices with minimal accuracy loss

### Performance Considerations
- SVD is O(min(m,n)²k) where k is n_components
- Memory usage scales with matrix size and n_components
- Caching critical since SVD is expensive to compute
- Consider incremental SVD for very large corpora

### Clustering Strategy
- K-means works well in LSA-reduced space
- Start with sqrt(n/2) clusters as rule of thumb
- Silhouette score validates cluster quality
- Consider hierarchical clustering for dendrograms

### Topic Interpretation
- Topics are linear combinations of terms
- Both positive and negative weights meaningful
- Topic coherence can be measured with PMI
- Human validation often needed for naming
