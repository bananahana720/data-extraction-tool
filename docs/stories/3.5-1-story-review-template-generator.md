# Story 3.5.1: Story/Review Template Generator

Status: backlog

## Story

As a scrum master responsible for maintaining story quality standards,
I want an automated story/review template generator with AC tables and wiring checklists,
so that developers cannot skip required sections and evidence is captured before review status changes.

### Story Header

- **Story Key:** `3.5-1-story-review-template-generator` (Epic 3.5, Story ID 3.5.1)
- **Context:** Addresses Epic 3 retrospective finding that missing provenance/metadata reminders caused AC failures (AC 3.4-6, 3.5-7) and post-review evidence gaps. [Source: docs/retrospectives/epic-3-retro-2025-11-16.md#L19-L24]
- **Dependencies:** None (foundation story for Epic 3.5)
- **Estimate:** 4 hours
- **Owner:** Elena + DevOps

### Story Body

Implementation will create a Jinja2-based story markdown generator (`scripts/new-story`) that outputs ready-to-edit story files with pre-populated AC tables, wiring checklists (BOM, logging, CLI flags), and submission summaries. Pre-commit hooks will validate AC table completeness before allowing commits, enforcing the "evidence-first review" pattern identified in the Epic 3 retrospective. The generator must integrate with existing BMAD workflow conventions while remaining simple enough for rapid story creation (<5 minutes per story). [Source: docs/retrospectives/epic-3-retro-2025-11-16.md#L46-L48]

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **CLI interface:** `scripts/new-story` command accepts `--id`, `--title`, `--owner`, `--hours` parameters and generates valid story markdown. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-3.5.md#L82-L93]
2. **Template completeness:** Generated story includes AC table template, wiring checklist (BOM, logging, CLI, testing), submission summary section. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-3.5.md#L82-L93]
3. **Jinja2 rendering:** Templates use Jinja2 syntax with variables for story_id, story_title, epic_id, owner, estimated_hours, acceptance_criteria. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-3.5.md#L71-L93]
4. **Pre-commit validation:** Pre-commit hook validates AC table presence and structure before allowing story file commits. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-3.5.md#L95-L103]
5. **Quality gates:** Black/Ruff/Mypy pass with 0 violations, unit tests cover template rendering and CLI args. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-3.5.md#L226-L230]
6. **Story 4.1 validation:** Successfully generate Story 4.1 using the new template generator as integration test. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-3.5.md#L47-L48]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Create Jinja2 templates (AC: 2-3)**
  - [ ] Create `scripts/templates/story.md.j2` with story header, body, AC table placeholders
  - [ ] Create `scripts/templates/ac-table.md.j2` for acceptance criteria evidence table
  - [ ] Create `scripts/templates/wiring-checklist.md.j2` for BOM/logging/CLI/testing reminders
  - [ ] Test template rendering with sample variables

- [ ] **Task 2: Implement generator CLI (AC: 1)**
  - [ ] Create `scripts/new-story` entry point with argparse/click for CLI args
  - [ ] Implement `scripts/generator.py` with Jinja2 rendering logic
  - [ ] Add file output to `docs/stories/{story-id}-{title-slug}.md`
  - [ ] Add `--dry-run` flag for preview without writing

- [ ] **Task 3: Pre-commit validation hook (AC: 4)**
  - [ ] Create `scripts/validators.py` with AC table structure validation
  - [ ] Add pre-commit hook configuration to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
  - [ ] Test hook rejects stories with incomplete AC tables
  - [ ] Document hook behavior in `docs/processes/story-quality-enforcement.md`

- [ ] **Task 4: Tests and documentation (AC: 5-6)**
  - [ ] Unit tests: Template rendering, CLI argument parsing, file output, validation logic
  - [ ] Integration test: Generate Story 4.1 and verify output structure
  - [ ] Run quality gates: Black, Ruff, Mypy
  - [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with template generator usage instructions

## Dev Notes

### Requirements Context Summary

- **Retrospective finding:** Missing provenance/metadata reminders in story templates caused AC failures and extra review cycles in Epic 3. [Source: docs/retrospectives/epic-3-retro-2025-11-16.md#L19-L24]
- **Action plan item #1:** Create story/review template generator by 2025-11-20 with Elena + DevOps ownership. [Source: docs/retrospectives/epic-3-retro-2025-11-16.md#L46-L48]
- **Success criteria:** Story 4.1 must use this generator successfully, proving the template is ready for Epic 4 development. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-3.5.md#L47-L48]

### Structure Alignment Summary

- Template structure follows existing Epic 3 story format (Story 3.7 pattern with Story Header, Body, AC, Tasks, Dev Notes sections).
- Generator outputs go to `docs/stories/` following existing naming convention: `{epic}-{story}-{title-slug}.md`.
- Pre-commit hooks extend existing `.pre-commit-config.yaml` infrastructure.
