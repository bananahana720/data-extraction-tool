# Story 3.5.2: CLAUDE.md Lessons Section

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As an AI development agent working on this codebase,
I want a consolidated "Lessons & Reminders" section in CLAUDE.md (≤100 lines),
so that critical guidelines from Epic 1-3 retrospectives are visible every session and referenced by template scripts.

### Story Header

- **Story Key:** `3.5-2-claude-md-lessons-section` (Epic 3.5, Story ID 3.5.2)
- **Context:** Addresses Epic 3 retrospective lesson that "automation > memory" – development guidelines must be encoded so agents/humans cannot omit them. [Source: docs/retrospectives/epic-3-retro-2025-11-16.md#L26-L30]
- **Dependencies:** Epic 1-3 retrospective documents (source material)
- **Estimate:** 2 hours
- **Owner:** Bob (Scrum Master)

### Story Body

Implementation will create a new "Lessons & Reminders" section in `docs/CLAUDE.md` that consolidates critical learnings from Epic 1-3 retrospectives into ≤100 lines of concise, actionable guidance. The section will cover story development patterns (AC evidence, BOM sections, logging, CLI wiring), code quality workflows (mypy execution, immediate violation fixes), testing strategies (structure mirroring, integration tests for NFRs), and documentation requirements (ADR ownership, performance baselines). This section must be referenced by the story template generator (Story 3.5.1) to ensure compliance. [Source: docs/retrospectives/epic-3-retro-2025-11-16.md#L49]

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Section exists:** CLAUDE.md contains "Lessons & Reminders" section with Epic 1-3 consolidated learnings. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-3.5.md#L105-L137]
2. **Word count:** Section is ≤100 lines (excluding section header), concise and scannable. [Source: docs/retrospectives/epic-3-retro-2025-11-16.md#L49]
3. **Coverage areas:** Includes subsections for Story Development, Code Quality, Testing, Documentation per tech spec template. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-3.5.md#L105-L137]
4. **Referenced by scripts:** Story template generator (Story 3.5.1) references this section in generated story files. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-3.5.md#L137]
5. **Actionable content:** Each guideline is specific and actionable (e.g., "Run mypy from project root", "Fill AC table before review status"). [Source: docs/retrospectives/epic-3-retro-2025-11-16.md#L26-L30]

## Dev Notes

### Requirements Context Summary

- **Retrospective lesson:** "Automation > Memory" – template/scripts must encode guidelines so humans/agents cannot omit them. [Source: docs/retrospectives/epic-3-retro-2025-11-16.md#L26-L30]
- **Action plan item #2:** Create CLAUDE.md "Lessons & Reminders" section (≤100 lines) by 2025-11-21 with Bob ownership. [Source: docs/retrospectives/epic-3-retro-2025-11-16.md#L49]
- **Success criteria:** Section referenced by template script and guidelines visible every AI session. [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-3.5.md#L137]

### Structure Alignment Summary

- Section follows CLAUDE.md existing structure (markdown with H2/H3 headers, bullet lists, code examples).
- Placement after "Epic-Based Development" section and before "Configuration" section.
- Uses same formatting as existing CLAUDE.md sections for consistency.
