## Dev Notes

### Architecture Alignment

**Core Pipeline Architecture (from architecture.md):**
This story establishes the foundational project structure that will support the modular pipeline architecture defined in the Architecture document. The pipeline pattern (extract → normalize → chunk → semantic → output) will be built on this foundation in Story 1.4.

**Technology Stack Decisions (from architecture.md ADRs):**
- **Python 3.12:** Mandatory enterprise requirement (ADR-004, NFR-C1)
- **Pydantic v2:** For data models with runtime validation (ADR-002)
- **Typer:** Modern CLI framework (ADR-001) - will be used in Epic 5
- **Rich:** Terminal UI for progress bars (ADR-001) - will be used in Epic 5
- **pytest + ruff + mypy + black:** Testing and code quality stack

**Key Dependencies to Pin in pyproject.toml:**
Core (Epic 1 Foundation):
- pydantic >= 2.0.0, < 3.0
- PyYAML >= 6.0.0, < 7.0
- python-dotenv >= 1.0.0, < 2.0
- structlog >= 24.0.0, < 25.0

Development Tools:
- pytest >= 8.0.0, < 9.0
- pytest-cov >= 5.0.0, < 6.0
- pytest-xdist >= 3.6.0, < 4.0
- ruff >= 0.6.0, < 0.7
- mypy >= 1.11.0, < 2.0
- black >= 24.0.0, < 25.0
- pre-commit >= 3.0.0, < 4.0

**Note:** Processing dependencies (spaCy, scikit-learn, PyMuPDF, etc.) will be added in subsequent epics. Epic 1 focuses on foundation only.

**This Story Creates:**
- Root project files: pyproject.toml, README.md, .gitignore, .pre-commit-config.yaml
- src/data_extract/ package structure (empty modules, populated in later stories)
- tests/ directory structure (populated in Story 1.3)
- config/ and scripts/ directories

### Testing Standards Summary

**Testing Framework (from architecture.md and tech-spec):**
- pytest as primary test framework
- pytest-cov for coverage reporting (target: >60% for Epic 1, >80% for MVP)
- pytest-xdist for parallel test execution
- Test structure mirrors src/ organization
- Three test levels: unit/, integration/, performance/

**Test Fixtures (Story 1.3):**
Test fixtures will be created in Story 1.3. This story focuses only on establishing the testing infrastructure (directory structure, pytest configuration).

**Coverage Strategy (from tech-spec):**
- Epic 1: >60% baseline
- Epic 2-4: >80% overall
- Epic 5: >90% for critical paths

### Configuration Management

**Three-Tier Precedence (from architecture.md):**
1. CLI flags (highest precedence)
2. Environment variables (DATA_EXTRACT_* prefix)
3. YAML config file (~/.data-extract/config.yaml or project-local)
4. Hardcoded defaults (lowest precedence)

**This Story:**
- Sets up project-level configuration infrastructure
- Creates config/ directory for templates
- Actual configuration management will be implemented in Epic 5

### Pre-commit Hook Configuration

**Hooks to Configure (from architecture.md):**
- **black:** Code formatting (opinionated, no configuration)
- **ruff:** Fast Python linter (replaces flake8, isort)
- **mypy:** Static type checking

**Execution:**
Hooks run automatically on `git commit`. Can be bypassed with `--no-verify` flag if needed, but should generally be enforced for code quality.

### Brownfield Context

**Existing Foundation (from PRD and tech-spec):**
This is a **brownfield project** with some existing extraction capabilities. Story 1.2 (Brownfield Codebase Assessment) will analyze and document what already exists.

**This Story's Approach:**
- Create clean project structure from scratch
- Existing code will be refactored and integrated in subsequent stories (after assessment)
- Do NOT try to integrate existing code in this story - focus on foundation only

### Platform-Specific Considerations

**Operating System Compatibility (NFR-C2):**
- Primary target: Windows (enterprise environment)
- Secondary: macOS, Linux (for portability)
- Use `pathlib` for cross-platform file paths
- Handle line endings appropriately (CRLF on Windows, LF on Unix)

**Virtual Environment Activation:**
- Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
- Unix/Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Document both in README.md

### References

**Source Documents:**
- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md#project-structure) - Project structure and technology decisions
- [Tech Spec Epic 1](docs/tech-spec-epic-1.md#story-1-1) - Detailed acceptance criteria and dependencies
- [PRD](docs/PRD.md#nfr-c1-python-version) - Enterprise Python 3.12 requirement
- [Epics](docs/epics.md#story-1-1) - User story and context

**Key Architecture Decisions:**
- ADR-001: Typer over Click for CLI (Epic 5)
- ADR-002: Pydantic over dataclasses (Story 1.4)
- ADR-004: Python 3.12 only (enterprise constraint)

**NFRs Addressed:**
- NFR-C1: Python 3.12 mandatory
- NFR-M1: Code clarity through modular structure
- NFR-M4: Testability through pytest infrastructure
- NFR-A1: Traceability through version control and deterministic builds

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer**: andrew
**Date**: 2025-11-10
**Outcome**: **CHANGES REQUESTED**

**Justification**: One MEDIUM severity code quality issue (mypy pre-commit hook configuration) and three LOW severity improvements identified. All acceptance criteria are fully implemented, all tasks verified complete, but code quality improvements recommended before marking story as done.

### Summary

Story 1.1 (Project Infrastructure Initialization) successfully establishes a Python 3.12+ development environment with comprehensive dependency management, development toolchain, and project structure following modern Python conventions. All 6 acceptance criteria are fully implemented, and all 8 tasks have been verified complete with evidence.

The implementation demonstrates excellent attention to detail, proper adherence to Epic 1 technical specifications, and strong alignment with the architecture document. The story is functionally complete and ready for development work to begin.

However, one MEDIUM severity code quality issue and several LOW severity improvements have been identified that should be addressed to ensure maintainability and prevent future issues.

### Key Findings

**HIGH Severity**: None ✅

**MEDIUM Severity**:
- **[Medium]** Mypy pre-commit hook may hide real dependency issues (.pre-commit-config.yaml:29) - `--ignore-missing-imports` flag suppresses legitimate type checking errors

**LOW Severity**:
- **[Low]** Incomplete mypy configuration (pyproject.toml:120-125) - Missing brownfield code exclusions
- **[Low]** Tool version targets could specify broader compatibility (pyproject.toml:111, 116, 121) - Minor inconsistency
- **[Low]** Incomplete installation verification guidance (README.md:81-98) - Missing expected output documentation

**Advisory**:
- Consider adding pytest coverage threshold configuration for Epic 1 (>60% target)
- README missing troubleshooting section for common setup failures

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Current State**:
- Existing test suite: 1007 tests collected (brownfield codebase)
- New package structure: Placeholder files only (appropriate for Epic 1 foundation)
- pytest configured correctly in pyproject.toml:102-107
- pytest-cov and pytest-xdist available

**Coverage Target**: Epic 1 baseline >60% (will be addressed in Story 1.3)

### Architectural Alignment

**✅ Excellent alignment with Epic 1 technical specification**:

1. **Project Structure**: Matches tech-spec lines 60-77 exactly - all 9 pipeline packages created
2. **Dependencies**: All Epic 1 dependencies present and correctly pinned (tech-spec lines 359-381)
3. **ADR Compliance**:
   - ADR-002 (Pydantic v2): pydantic >=2.0.0,<3.0 ✅
   - ADR-004 (Python 3.12 mandatory): pyproject.toml:10 enforces >=3.12 ✅
   - NFR-C1 (Enterprise requirement): Python 3.13.9 forward compatible ✅
4. **Code Quality**: Pre-commit hooks (black, ruff, mypy) match architecture specs ✅

**No architecture violations found** ✅

### Security Notes

**✅ No security issues identified**:
- All dependencies from official PyPI with pinned versions
- .gitignore excludes .env files (lines 48-49)
- No hardcoded credentials
- No external API calls or cloud dependencies
- File permissions not modified

### Best Practices and References

**Tech Stack**: Python 3.12+ with pyproject.toml (PEP 621), pip, pytest, black, ruff, mypy, pre-commit

**Best Practices Applied**:
- PEP 621 compliance for modern project metadata
- Dependency pinning for reproducibility (audit requirement)
- src/ layout pattern (PyPA recommended)
- Pre-commit hooks enforce code quality

**References**:
- [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) - pyproject.toml standard
- [Python Packaging Guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/) - src/ layout
- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/), [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)

### Action Items

**Code Changes Required:**

- [x] [Medium] Fix mypy pre-commit hook configuration [file: .pre-commit-config.yaml:29]
  - Remove `--ignore-missing-imports` flag to avoid hiding real dependency issues
  - Add type stubs for typed dependencies: `additional_dependencies: [..., "types-python-dotenv"]`

- [x] [Low] Add mypy exclusions for brownfield code [file: pyproject.toml:125]
  - Add `exclude = ["src/(cli|extractors|processors|formatters|core|pipeline|infrastructure)/"]`
  - Focuses type checking on new data_extract package only

- [x] [Low] Document expected verification output [file: README.md:81-98]
  - Add "Expected output" notes after verification commands
  - Example: "Expected: collected 1007 items" for pytest

**Advisory Notes:**

- Note: Consider adding pytest coverage threshold `--cov-fail-under=60` when Story 1.3 establishes test framework
- Note: README could benefit from troubleshooting section in future updates
- Note: Tool version targets could specify Python 3.13 compatibility (minor, not blocking)

### Previous Review Action Items - Resolution Verification

**✅ [MEDIUM] Mypy pre-commit hook configuration fixed:**
- **VERIFIED**: .pre-commit-config.yaml:25-31
- `--ignore-missing-imports` flag successfully REMOVED (was at line 29 in previous version)
- `types-python-dotenv` successfully ADDED to additional_dependencies (line 29)
- Files pattern correctly targets ^src/data_extract/ (line 31)
- **Status**: COMPLETE AND VERIFIED ✅

**✅ [LOW] Mypy brownfield exclusions added:**
- **VERIFIED**: pyproject.toml:125-127
- Exclude pattern added: `"src/(cli|extractors|processors|formatters|core|pipeline|infrastructure)/"`
- Type checking now focused on new data_extract package only
- **Status**: COMPLETE AND VERIFIED ✅

**✅ [LOW] README verification documentation enhanced:**
- **VERIFIED**: README.md:81-103
- Expected output added for pytest: "collected 1007 items" (line 84)
- Expected output added for black: "All done! ✨ 🍰 ✨" (line 88)
- Expected output added for ruff: "No output if no issues found" (line 92)
- Expected output added for mypy: "Success: no issues found in X source files" (line 96)
- Expected output added for CLI: "Placeholder message" (line 100)
- **Status**: COMPLETE AND VERIFIED ✅

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Current State**:
- Existing brownfield test suite: 1007 tests (documented in README:84)
- New package structure: Placeholder files (appropriate for Epic 1 foundation)
- pytest configured correctly (pyproject.toml:102-107)
- All testing dependencies installed

**Assessment**: Test infrastructure properly established for Epic 1. Story 1.3 will enhance test framework.

### Architectural Alignment

2. **Dependencies**: All Epic 1 dependencies properly pinned
3. **ADR Compliance**:
   - ADR-002 (Pydantic v2): ✅
   - ADR-004 (Python 3.12 mandatory): ✅ (3.13.9 forward compatible)
4. **Code Quality**: Pre-commit hooks properly configured with fixes applied ✅
5. **Configuration**: mypy properly configured to exclude brownfield code ✅

**No architecture violations** ✅

### Security Notes

**✅ No security issues**:
- All dependencies from official PyPI with pinned versions
- .gitignore excludes sensitive files (.env, .env.local at lines 48-49)
- No hardcoded credentials
- No security vulnerabilities identified
- Pre-commit hooks configured to catch debug statements

### Best Practices and References
