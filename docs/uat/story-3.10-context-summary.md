# Story 3.10 Context Assembly Summary

**Generated:** 2025-11-17
**Workflow:** /bmad:bmm:workflows:story-context
**Story:** follow-up-3.10-excel-import-validation-test

## Workflow Completion Status ✅

The story-context workflow for Story 3.10 (Add Excel Import Validation Test) has been successfully executed and completed.

## Generated Files

1. **Story Context XML:** `/home/user/data-extraction-tool/docs/stories/follow-up-3.10-excel-import-validation-test.context.xml`
   - Complete story context with all required sections
   - Ready for developer implementation

## Context Assembled

### Documentation Gathered
- **Traceability Matrix (Epic 3):** Identified AC-3.6-4 as PARTIAL coverage needing Excel validation
- **Story 3.6 CSV Output Format:** Parent story defining canonical 10-column schema
- **Epic 3 Test Design:** Risk R-010 addressing Excel truncation concerns

### Code Artifacts Located
- **test_csv_formatter.py:** Existing CSV formatter tests defining the interface
- **test_csv_parser_validator.py:** Current parser validation that Story 3.10 extends
- **test_csv_pipeline.py:** Integration tests for end-to-end CSV pipeline

### Dependencies Identified
- **openpyxl ^3.0.10:** Already present in pyproject.toml (Excel read/write support)
- **pandas ^2.0.0:** Available in dev dependencies for dataframe validation
- **csvkit ^2.0.0:** CLI validation tools

### Constraints Captured
- Test location: `tests/integration/test_output/test_csv_compatibility.py`
- Formula injection prevention required (escape =, +, -, @)
- UTF-8-sig encoding for Windows Excel compatibility
- Canonical 10-column schema adherence
- 300-line test file limit per DoD

### Interfaces Documented
- CsvFormatter class interface
- CsvParserValidator validation interface
- FormatResult dataclass structure

### Testing Standards Applied
- pytest framework with fixtures
- Unit/integration/performance test organization
- 80%+ coverage requirement for greenfield code
- Pre-commit quality gates (black, ruff, mypy)

## Key Findings and Notes

1. **Story Status:** The story is currently in "todo" status rather than "drafted". Normally the workflow requires "drafted" status, but proceeded per explicit user request.

2. **Excel Validation Gap:** This story directly addresses Gap 3 from the traceability matrix - AC-3.6-4 only has PARTIAL coverage with manual UAT required for Excel/Sheets.

3. **Dependencies Ready:** All required dependencies (openpyxl, pandas, csvkit) are already present in the project configuration.

4. **Security Consideration:** Formula injection prevention is a critical security requirement to prevent malicious Excel formula execution.

5. **Test Organization:** Tests will extend existing CSV validation infrastructure rather than creating new patterns.

## Next Steps

1. **Review Context File:** Examine the generated context XML at `docs/stories/follow-up-3.10-excel-import-validation-test.context.xml`

2. **Update Story Status:** When ready to implement, update story status from "todo" to "drafted" then "ready-for-dev"

3. **Implementation:** Developer can use the context file to implement the three test functions:
   - `test_excel_import_validation`
   - `test_excel_special_characters`
   - `test_excel_formula_injection_prevention`

4. **Validation:** Run the tests and update the traceability matrix AC-3.6-4 from PARTIAL to FULL coverage

## Workflow Tracking

- **Workflow Started:** 2025-11-17
- **Context File Generated:** Successfully created
- **Checklist Validation:** All 10 items validated ✓
- **Sprint Status Update:** Not updated (story status is "todo", not "drafted")

---

**Note:** The story-context workflow completed successfully despite the story being in "todo" status rather than "drafted" status, as this was explicitly requested by the user for Story 3.10 Excel Import Validation Test.
