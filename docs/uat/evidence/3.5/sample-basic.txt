This is a sample document demonstrating the plain text output format. The text has been cleaned of all markdown and HTML artifacts, making it ready for direct upload to LLM chat interfaces.

This paragraph shows that double-newline paragraph breaks are preserved for readability. The output is deterministic and artifact-free.

This second chunk demonstrates sequential numbering with zero-padding. Unicode characters like Café, résumé, and emoji 🚀 are perfectly preserved.

The delimiter pattern uses Unicode box-drawing characters for visual clarity.
