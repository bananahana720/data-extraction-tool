# Epic 4/5 Action Plan - Executive Summary
**Generated**: 2025-11-20
**From**: Epic 4/5 Deployment Readiness Assessment

## 🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS

**Deployment Readiness**: **3/10** - NOT READY

**Key Issues**:
1. **Zero behavioral tests** for semantic features
2. **908-line test design** with 0% implementation
3. **Unsustainable velocity** (11 stories in 2 days)
4. **Script complexity explosion** (1000+ line monoliths)

## 📋 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN (Next 2 Weeks)

### Week 1: "Test Reality Sprint"
**Owner**: Charlie (Lead Dev) + Dana (QA)

| Priority | Action | Days | Success Criteria |
|----------|--------|------|------------------|
| P0 | Delete all generated tests | 0.5 | Clean test directory |
| P0 | Write 5 behavioral semantic tests | 2 | Tests validate correctness, not structure |
| P0 | Create CLI deployment runbook | 1 | Step-by-step production deployment |
| P1 | Modularize scan_security.py | 1.5 | Split into <500 line modules |

### Week 2: "Operational Readiness"
**Owner**: Andrew (Tech Lead) + Bob (SM)

| Priority | Action | Days | Success Criteria |
|----------|--------|------|------------------|
| P0 | Implement 1 integration test | 2 | Real semantic pipeline validation |
| P0 | Add monitoring endpoint | 1 | Basic health/metrics check |
| P1 | Document failure modes | 1 | Known issues and mitigations |
| P1 | Create rollback procedure | 1 | Tested rollback script |

## 🎯 EPIC 4 MODIFICATIONS

### MUST DO Before Start:
1. ✅ Complete Test Reality Sprint
2. ✅ Reduce story scope to 5 stories max
3. ✅ Focus on semantic correctness, NOT performance
4. ✅ Test behavior continuously during development

### SKIP (YAGNI):
1. ❌ 50 test templates from design document
2. ❌ Performance optimization (at 7.6% capacity!)
3. ❌ Complex configuration management
4. ❌ Real-time progress indicators

## 🔄 EPIC 5 RADICAL SIMPLIFICATION

### Original Plan → New Plan:
- ~~7 stories~~ → **3 stories**
- ~~Configuration system~~ → **Use existing YAML**
- ~~5 output formats~~ → **1 format (JSON)**
- ~~Real-time progress~~ → **Simple logging**
- ~~Batch optimization~~ → **Current performance sufficient**

## 📊 VELOCITY RECALIBRATION

### Sustainable Pace:
- **Current**: 11 stories/2 days = **DEATH MARCH**
- **Target**: 3-5 stories/week = **SUSTAINABLE**
- **Reality**: 1 story/developer/week with quality

## 🏗️ ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS NEEDED

### Accept Reality:
1. **CLI-only deployment** (no containers in enterprise)
2. **File-based storage** (no database needed)
3. **Classical NLP only** (no transformers)
4. **Manual deployment** (no CI/CD initially)

### New ADRs Required:
1. **ADR-013**: Test Strategy (behavior > coverage)
2. **ADR-014**: Deployment Approach (CLI + runbook)
3. **ADR-015**: Good Enough Philosophy
4. **ADR-016**: Script Complexity Limits (<500 lines)

## ⚠️ RISK MITIGATION

| Risk | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|-------|
| Semantic incorrectness | 5 golden behavioral tests | Dana |
| Team burnout | Enforce 3-5 stories/week | Bob |
| Script maintenance | Immediate modularization | Charlie |
| Deployment failure | Tested runbook + rollback | Andrew |

## 🚀 GO/NO-GO DECISION POINTS

### Epic 4 Can Start When:
- [ ] 5 behavioral tests passing
- [ ] Deployment runbook tested
- [ ] Team agrees to reduced scope
- [ ] Velocity reset to sustainable

### Epic 5 Can Start When:
- [ ] Epic 4 behavioral validation proven
- [ ] Simplified scope accepted
- [ ] Script modularization complete
- [ ] Team health restored

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

**Winston's Wisdom**:
> "We built a Ferrari engine in a go-kart. Simplify the chassis, not the engine."

**Murat's Mandate**:
> "Five real tests beat five hundred fake tests. Test behavior, not structure."

**Bottom Line**:
> "Architecturally sound, operationally naive. Fix operations or fail in production."

## DECISION REQUIRED

**Option A: Test Reality Sprint** (Recommended)
- 2-week pause for operational readiness
- Delete generated tests, write real ones
- Sustainable pace moving forward

**Option B: YOLO to Production** (Not Recommended)
- Ship untested semantic features
- Accept production failures
- Fix in production (pray for forgiveness)

**Recommendation**: **OPTION A** - Two weeks now saves months of production debugging.
