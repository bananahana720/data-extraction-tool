# Domain-Specific Requirements

**Context:** Cybersecurity Internal Audit in F100 enterprise operates under unique constraints and requirements that shape all aspects of this tool.

## Regulatory & Compliance Considerations

**Enterprise IT Restrictions:**
- **Python 3.12 Mandatory:** Enterprise standardization requirement—no older versions acceptable
- **No Transformer Models:** Corporate policy prohibits transformer-based LLMs (BERT, GPT, T5, etc.)
- **No External LLM APIs:** Cannot use OpenAI, Anthropic, or cloud-based AI services
- **On-Premise Processing Only:** All data processing must occur locally (no cloud dependencies)

**Data Sensitivity:**
- Audit documents contain confidential enterprise information (security controls, risk assessments, compliance gaps)
- Tool must not transmit data externally or create security vulnerabilities
- Access controls and logging may be required for enterprise deployment
- Output files must maintain appropriate sensitivity classification

**Audit Trail Requirements:**
- Processing must be **deterministic** (same input → same output, every time)
- Ability to reproduce results for audit validation
- Logging of processing decisions (which chunks were flagged, why entities were identified)
- Version control of configuration used for processing

## Domain Standards & Entity Types

**Structured Entity Model:**

The audit domain has well-defined entity types that must be preserved:

1. **Processes:** Business processes under audit review
2. **Risks:** Identified cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities
3. **Controls:** Security controls and safeguards
4. **Regulations:** Applicable regulatory frameworks (SOX, GDPR, etc.)
5. **Policies:** Corporate security policies and standards
6. **Issues/Findings:** Audit findings and recommendations

**Entity Requirements:**
- Consistent naming and formatting across documents
- Relationship preservation (which controls mitigate which risks)
- Hierarchy awareness (parent/child relationships in control frameworks)
- Cross-reference handling (when documents reference other documents by ID)

**GRC Platform Specifics (Archer):**
- Archer exports contain structured data with specific field schemas
- HTML/XML exports may include hyperlinks representing entity relationships
- Field names and structure vary by Archer module (Risk Management, Compliance, Issues)
- Some exports include embedded workflow states and audit metadata

## Industry-Specific Patterns

**Compliance Documentation Patterns:**
- Control matrices (rows = processes, columns = controls)
- Risk registers (structured tables with likelihood/impact ratings)
- SOC 2 / ISO 27001 control mappings
- Gap analyses (current state vs. required state)
- Remediation plans with ownership and timelines

**Document Structure Conventions:**
- Executive summaries → Detailed findings → Recommendations → Appendices
- Version control and approval signatures in headers/footers
- Cross-references to other audit documents
- Embedded evidence (screenshots, log excerpts, configuration exports)

**Terminology & Jargon:**
- Domain-specific acronyms (GRC, SOX, NIST CSF, CIS Controls, etc.)
- Audit-specific language (material weakness, significant deficiency, observation)
- Technical security terms (zero trust, least privilege, MFA, etc.)

## Required Validations

**Quality Gates:**
- **Completeness Validation:** Ensure all text content extracted (no silent data loss)
- **OCR Confidence Scoring:** Flag low-confidence OCR results for manual review
- **Entity Recognition Validation:** Cross-check identified entities against known lists
- **Chunk Quality Validation:** Ensure chunks are semantically coherent (not mid-sentence splits)
- **Format Conversion Validation:** Verify tables/structures preserved accurately

**Error Handling Requirements:**
- Graceful degradation (continue processing batch even if one file fails)
- Detailed error logging with actionable guidance
- Quarantine problematic files for manual inspection
- Summary reporting of processing issues across batch

## Impact on Feature Priorities

**Mandatory Features (Driven by Domain):**
- Entity normalization (domain-specific entity types)
- Deterministic processing (audit reproducibility)
- Quality validation and flagging (accuracy requirements)
- Comprehensive logging (audit trail)
- Schema standardization for Archer exports

**Critical NFRs (Driven by Domain):**
- Security (data sensitivity, on-premise requirement)
- Reliability (no silent failures, graceful error handling)
- Auditability (logging, deterministic results)
- Accuracy (>95% OCR, entity preservation)

**Development Sequencing (Informed by Domain):**
1. **Phase 1:** Normalization layer (foundation for everything else)
2. **Phase 2:** Quality validation (catch issues early)
3. **Phase 3:** Semantic processing (builds on clean, validated data)
4. **Phase 4:** Advanced features (knowledge graphs, custom NER)

## Special Expertise Needed

**Technical Knowledge:**
- Classical NLP techniques (TF-IDF, LSA, Word2Vec, LDA)
- Document structure analysis and parsing
- OCR quality assessment and improvement
- Semantic chunking strategies for RAG

**Domain Knowledge:**
- Audit entity types and relationships
- GRC platform data structures (Archer)
- Compliance framework mappings
- Cybersecurity terminology and concepts

**Note:** You have strong domain knowledge but are learning semantic analysis—tool should provide clear explanations and configuration guidance to support this learning curve.
