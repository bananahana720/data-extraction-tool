# Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements focus on **how the system performs** rather than what it does. Only NFRs critical to this tool's success are documented here.

## Performance

**Rationale:** Batch processing is the core use case—performance directly impacts usability for processing audit engagement documents (50-200 files).

**NFR-P1: Batch Processing Throughput**
- Process 100 mixed-format files in <10 minutes on typical workstation (Intel i5/i7, 16GB RAM, SSD)
- Individual file processing: <5 seconds per document (excluding OCR)
- OCR processing: <10 seconds per scanned page with preprocessing
- **Target:** ~100 files/hour sustained throughput for mixed workloads
- **Measurement:** Benchmark with representative audit document set

**NFR-P2: Memory Efficiency**
- Maximum memory footprint: 2GB RAM during batch processing
- Streaming processing architecture (don't load all files into memory)
- Graceful handling of large files (>100MB PDFs, >10K row Excel files)
- Memory released after each file processed in batch
- **Rationale:** Enable processing on typical workstations without memory pressure

**NFR-P3: Responsive Feedback**
- Progress bar updates at least every 2 seconds
- Verbose output streams in real-time (not buffered)
- Command response time: <1 second for non-processing commands (config, info, validate)
- **Rationale:** User confidence during long-running batches

**NFR-P4: Scalability to Document Collections**
- Support processing up to 1,000 documents in single batch
- Support document collections up to 10,000 total documents for similarity analysis
- Similarity matrix computation: <5 minutes for 1,000 documents
- **Rationale:** Handle large audit engagements and multi-year document repositories

## Security

**Rationale:** Processing sensitive enterprise audit documents with strict confidentiality requirements and enterprise IT policies.

**NFR-S1: Data Confidentiality**
- All processing occurs locally (no external network calls)
- No data transmission to cloud services or external APIs
- No telemetry or usage data collection
- Temporary files stored securely with appropriate permissions (user-only read/write)
- Option to securely delete temporary files after processing
- **Domain Constraint:** F100 security policy requires on-premise processing

**NFR-S2: Dependency Security**
- All dependencies from trusted sources (PyPI official packages)
- No dependencies on transformer-based models or external LLM services
- Minimal dependency chain to reduce attack surface
- Pin dependency versions for reproducibility and security auditing
- **Domain Constraint:** Enterprise IT restrictions prohibit transformer models

**NFR-S3: Input Validation**
- Validate file types before processing (prevent malicious file exploits)
- Sanitize user inputs (file paths, configuration values)
- Safe handling of potentially malicious document content
- Graceful degradation on corrupted or malformed files
- **Rationale:** Prevent security vulnerabilities from untrusted input files

**NFR-S4: Output Security**
- Output files inherit appropriate sensitivity classification
- Configurable output directory permissions
- No sensitive data in log files (file paths only, not content)
- Option to encrypt output files (optional enhancement)
- **Rationale:** Maintain confidentiality of processed audit documents

## Reliability

**Rationale:** Accuracy-critical audit domain requires high reliability—no silent failures, deterministic processing.

**NFR-R1: Deterministic Processing**
- Same input files + same configuration → identical output (every time)
- No randomness in processing pipeline (fixed random seeds if needed)
- Consistent ordering in batch processing
- Reproducible results for audit validation
- **Domain Constraint:** Audit trail requirement—must be able to reproduce results

**NFR-R2: Graceful Degradation**
- No silent failures—flag problems rather than silently drop content
- Continue batch processing when individual files fail
- Clear error messages with actionable guidance
- Recovery options for partial failures
- **Domain Constraint:** Completeness critical for compliance—gaps must be visible

**NFR-R3: Error Handling**
- Catch and handle all expected error conditions gracefully
- Detailed error logging with stack traces for unexpected errors
- Exit codes reflect processing status (0=success, 1=partial, 2=failure)
- Quarantine problematic files for manual inspection
- Retry mechanism for transient errors
- **Rationale:** One bad file shouldn't block entire audit engagement processing

**NFR-R4: Data Integrity**
- Verify file integrity before processing (detect corrupted files)
- Validate output file integrity after writing
- Checksums/hashes for processed outputs
- Detect and flag incomplete processing
- **Domain Constraint:** Audit integrity requires complete, accurate processing

## Maintainability

**Rationale:** You're learning semantic analysis domain—code should be understandable, well-documented, and easy to enhance.

**NFR-M1: Code Clarity**
- Clear separation of concerns (extraction, normalization, chunking, analysis)
- Well-named functions and variables
- Type hints for function signatures (Python 3.12 typing)
- Minimal code complexity (prefer simple over clever)
- **Rationale:** Support learning and future enhancement

**NFR-M2: Documentation**
- Inline code comments explaining "why" not just "what"
- Docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Configuration examples and templates
- Explanation of semantic analysis concepts in tool output
- **Rationale:** Educational tool—help user learn classical NLP concepts

**NFR-M3: Modularity**
- Each processing stage (extraction, normalization, chunking, semantic) is independent
- Pipeline components are pluggable and replaceable
- Easy to add new file format support
- Easy to add new semantic analysis techniques
- **Rationale:** Composable building-block philosophy

**NFR-M4: Testability**
- Unit tests for core processing functions
- Integration tests with sample audit documents
- Test fixtures for each file format
- Regression tests for determinism validation
- **Rationale:** Ensure quality and prevent regressions during enhancement
