## Integration Strategy with Existing Infrastructure

### 1. Pre-commit Hook Integration

**Update `.pre-commit-config.yaml`**:
```yaml
repos:
  # Existing hooks...

  # Custom project hooks
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: validate-story-template
        name: Validate Story Template
        entry: python scripts/validate_story_template.py
        language: python
        files: '^docs/stories/.*\.md$'

      - id: check-dependencies
        name: Check Test Dependencies
        entry: python scripts/audit_dependencies.py --check
        language: python
        files: '^tests/.*\.py$'

      - id: quality-gates
        name: Run Quality Gates
        entry: python scripts/run_quality_gates.py --quick
        language: python
        pass_filenames: false
```

### 2. Claude Code Hooks Configuration

**Create `.claude/hooks/SessionStart`**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Initialize Claude Code session for data-extraction-tool

echo "🚀 Initializing data-extraction-tool environment..."
python scripts/init_claude_session.py

echo "📊 Current sprint status:"
python scripts/manage_sprint_status.py --summary

echo "✅ Environment ready. Current story: $(python scripts/get_current_story.py)"
```

**Create `.claude/hooks/PostToolUse`**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run after file modifications

if [[ "$1" == *"Edit"* ]] || [[ "$1" == *"Write"* ]]; then
    echo "🔍 Running quality checks..."
    python scripts/run_quality_gates.py --changed-only
fi
```

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Integration

**GitHub Actions Workflow Enhancement**:
```yaml
- name: Run Enhanced Quality Gates
  run: |
    python scripts/run_quality_gates.py --ci-mode
    python scripts/validate_performance.py
    python scripts/audit_dependencies.py --strict

- name: Generate Reports
  if: always()
  run: |

## Answers to Critical Questions

### Q1: What automation tasks are essential for the data-extraction-tool project?

**Essential Tasks**:
1. **Story Quality Enforcement**: Template generation with validation
2. **Dependency Management**: spaCy models, semantic libraries
3. **Performance Validation**: Against established baselines
4. **Test Generation**: From story ACs
5. **Environment Setup**: Consistent across developers
6. **Quality Gates**: Pre-commit and pre-PR validation

### Q2: Which scripts should be version-controlled vs environment-specific?

**Version-Controlled**:
- All scripts in scripts/ directory
- Claude Code hooks templates

**Environment-Specific (gitignored)**:
- Local Claude Code hooks with personal settings
- .env files with credentials
- Personal workflow scripts
- Machine-specific performance baselines

### Q3: How should scripts integrate with Claude Code hooks?

**Integration Pattern**:
1. SessionStart: Environment initialization
2. PreToolUse: Input validation, backup creation
3. PostToolUse: Quality checks, test execution
4. Stop: Report generation, status updates
5. Notification: Build failures, test results

### Q4: What build/deployment workflows need automation?

**Build Workflows**:
- Dependency installation with caching
- spaCy model management
- Multi-stage Docker builds
- Package generation

**Deployment Workflows**:
- Environment-specific configuration
