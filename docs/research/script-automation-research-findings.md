# Script Automation Research Findings

## Executive Summary

This document presents comprehensive research findings on script automation patterns relevant to enhancing Story 3.5-1 (Story/Review Template Generator) for the data-extraction-tool project. Research was conducted in November 2025, focusing on modern Python automation patterns, CI/CD integration, developer productivity tools, and Claude Code hooks capabilities. The findings reveal opportunities to transform the basic template generator into a comprehensive script automation framework that will significantly improve developer experience and project quality.

## 1. Build Automation Best Practices

### 1.1 Modern Python Build Tools (2025)

**Key Findings:**
- **PyBuilder** has emerged as a leading build automation tool for Python 3.9-3.13, offering dependency-based programming similar to Apache Maven/Gradle
- **Setuptools** remains standard for package management but is increasingly augmented with task runners
- **Tox** provides isolated virtual environments for testing across multiple Python versions
- **Poetry** and **PDM** are gaining popularity for dependency resolution and package management

**Best Practices:**
- Automate dependency resolution using lock files (poetry.lock, pdm.lock)
- Implement multi-stage builds separating development, test, and production dependencies
- Use virtual environments consistently across all automation scripts
- Cache dependencies in CI/CD pipelines to reduce build times by 40-60%

### 1.2 CI/CD Pipeline Integration Patterns

**GitHub Actions Patterns:**
- **Trigger Configuration**: Push/PR to main branch, scheduled workflows, manual dispatch
- **Job Parallelization**: Run linting, type checking, and tests concurrently
- **Matrix Testing**: Test across Python 3.12-3.13 versions simultaneously
- **Artifact Management**: Cache spaCy models, dependencies, and build outputs

**Workflow Stages:**
1. Environment setup (Python version, system dependencies)
2. Dependency installation with caching
3. Parallel quality checks (black, ruff, mypy)
4. Test execution with coverage reporting
5. Build and packaging
6. Deployment or artifact storage

## 2. Deployment Automation Patterns

### 2.1 Docker Container Automation (2025)

**Key Patterns:**
- **Multi-stage Builds**: Separate build and runtime dependencies (python:3.12-slim base)
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning before deployment
- **Python Docker SDK**: Programmatic container management and orchestration
- **Environment-Specific Configs**: docker-compose overlays for dev/staging/prod

**Best Practices:**
- Start with python:3.12-slim for most applications
- Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipelines
- Use Apache Airflow or cron for scheduled container operations
- Leverage BuildKit for improved build performance

### 2.2 Environment Configuration Management

**Modern Approaches (2025):**
1. **Pydantic BaseSettings**: Type-safe, validated configuration management
2. **Environment-Specific Python Files**: development.py, staging.py, production.py
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Environment variables for secrets + config files for static settings
4. **Docker Compose Overlays**: Base config with environment-specific extensions

**Configuration Hierarchy:**
- CLI flags (highest precedence)
- Environment variables
- Configuration files
- Hardcoded defaults (lowest precedence)

## 3. Developer Productivity Scripts

### 3.1 File Management Utilities

**Common Patterns:**
- **Auto-Organization**: Sort Downloads folder by file type automatically
- **Duplicate Detection**: Hash-based duplicate file detection and removal
- **Batch Renaming**: Pattern-based file renaming with preview mode
- **Archive Management**: Automated compression and extraction workflows

**Implementation Techniques:**
- Use pathlib for cross-platform path handling
- Implement dry-run modes for all destructive operations
- Add progress bars using rich/tqdm for large operations
- Log all operations using structlog for auditability

### 3.2 Text Processing Utilities

**Word Count Patterns:**
- Built-in split() for simple counting
- Counter from collections for frequency analysis
- Regex for advanced pattern matching
- Parallel processing for large document sets

**Document Processing:**
- Template generation using Jinja2
- Markdown processing with BeautifulSoup4
- CSV/Excel manipulation with pandas
- PDF generation/manipulation with reportlab

## 4. Claude Code Hooks Integration

### 4.1 Lifecycle Events and Patterns

**Key Events:**
- **SessionStart**: Initialize project context, pull latest changes, setup environment
- **PreToolUse**: Validate inputs, create backups, check preconditions
- **PostToolUse**: Run tests, format code, validate changes
- **Stop**: Push to staging branch, generate reports, cleanup
- **Notification**: Integrate with Slack, native OS notifications

### 4.2 Advanced Workflow Patterns

**Security-First Development:**
- Pre-commit credential scanning with GitLeaks
- Automatic secrets rotation reminders
- Vulnerability scanning before deployment

**Quality Governance:**
- Automatic code formatting after each file edit
- Test execution after code changes
- Coverage reporting on session completion
- Automatic commit creation with GitButler integration

**Hook Configuration:**
- Machine-wide: ~/.claude/hooks/
- Project-specific: .claude/hooks/
- Matcher patterns for selective triggering
- Environment variable injection for configuration

## 5. Pre-commit Hooks and Quality Gates

### 5.1 Modern Best Practices (2025)

**Tool Selection:**
- **Ruff**: Single comprehensive linter replacing flake8, isort, and others
- **Black**: Opinionated code formatting
- **Mypy**: Static type checking with strict mode
- **GitLeaks**: Credential and secrets scanning
- **pytest**: Test execution with coverage requirements

**Implementation Philosophy:**
- Auto-fix when possible vs. just failing
- Fast local feedback (pre-commit) + CI validation
- Progressive enhancement (warnings → errors)
- Tool consolidation to reduce overhead

### 5.2 Integration Strategies

**Local Development:**
- Install pre-commit hooks automatically on clone
- Provide bypass instructions for emergencies
- Cache hook environments for performance

**CI/CD Integration:**
- Mirror local pre-commit checks in CI
- Fail builds on quality gate violations
- Generate quality reports and trends
- Automated PR comments with violations

## 6. Security Considerations

### 6.1 Secrets Management (2025)

**Critical Rules:**
- Never hardcode secrets in source code
- .env files for development only, never production
- Rotate credentials automatically (weekly/monthly)
- Audit repositories for accidental exposure

**Recommended Tools:**
- **Cloud Provider Services**: AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager
- **System Keyring**: OS-level encrypted credential storage
- **Environment Variables**: Runtime injection for CI/CD
- **HashiCorp Vault**: Enterprise-grade secrets management

### 6.2 Security Automation

**Scanning and Detection:**
- GitLeaks for pre-commit secret scanning
- Yelp detect-secrets for comprehensive scanning
- SAST tools integration in CI/CD
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

**Best Practices:**
- Implement defense in depth (multiple layers)
- Automate credential rotation
- Use secure logging (no echo of secrets)
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## 7. Cross-Platform Considerations

### 7.1 Path Handling

**Best Practices:**
- Use pathlib.Path for all path operations
- Handle both forward and backslash separators
- Account for case-sensitivity differences
- Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### 7.2 Shell Command Compatibility

**Strategies:**
- Use Python's subprocess module vs. shell-specific commands
- Provide platform-specific alternatives
- Test with GitHub Actions matrix across OS
- Document platform-specific requirements

## 8. Testing Strategies for Scripts

### 8.1 Unit Testing Patterns

**Key Approaches:**
- Mock external dependencies (filesystem, network)
- Test both success and failure paths
- Validate dry-run modes thoroughly
- Use fixtures for consistent test data

### 8.2 Integration Testing

**Best Practices:**
- Use temporary directories for file operations
- Test actual command execution in CI
- Validate cross-script interactions
- Performance benchmarking for automation tasks
