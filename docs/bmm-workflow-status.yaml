# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Initial Status (before completion):
#   - required: Must be completed to progress
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - recommended: Strongly suggested but not required
#   - conditional: Required only if certain conditions met (e.g., if_has_ui)
#
# Completion Status:
#   - {file-path}: File created/found (e.g., "docs/product-brief.md")
#   - skipped: Optional/conditional workflow that was skipped

project: "data extraction tool for RAG-optimized knowledge curation"

# User Description:
# Two user journeys:
# A. Process audit files for AI agent/ChatGPT Enterprise upload - handles images, objects,
#    comments/annotations, scanned PDFs that cause RAG issues. Toggleable pre-processing
#    (semantic standardization, chunking, consolidation, schema standardization, metadata, quality indicators)
# B. NLP optimization for knowledge base curation using semantic analysis libraries
#    (automated or interactive CLI configuration)
#
# Constraints:
# - Hard: Python 3.12, no transformer-based LLMs (enterprise restrictions)
# - Soft: AI power user but lacks semantic analysis background, needs automation + explanations
# - Future: Consider GUI (currently CLI)
#
# Domain: Cybersecurity internal audit, F100 company, GRC platform (Archer)
# Entities: Highly structured (processes, risks, controls, regulations, policies, issues)
