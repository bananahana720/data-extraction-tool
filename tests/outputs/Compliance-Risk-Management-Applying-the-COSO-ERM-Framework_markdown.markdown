Why this publication is needed
Compliance risks are common and frequently material risks
to achieving an organization’s objectives. For many years,
compliance professionals have used a widely accepted
framework for compliance and ethics (C&E) programs to
prevent and timely detect noncompliance and other acts
of wrongdoing. The C&E program framework is described
in Appendix 1 (if readers are not already familiar with the
elements of a C&E program, consider reading Appendix 1

## before proceeding). The COSO Enterprise Risk Management

(ERM) Framework, meanwhile, has been used by risk and
other professionals to identify and mitigate a variety of
organizational risks, including compliance risks.
This publication aims to provide guidance on the application

## of the COSO ERM framework to the identification,

assessment, and management of compliance risks by
aligning it with the C&E program framework, creating a
powerful tool that integrates the concepts underlying each of
these valuable frameworks.
What are compliance and compliance-related risks?
Risk is defined by COSO as “the possibility that events will
occur and affect the achievement of strategy and business
objectives.” Risks considered in this definition include those
relating to all business objectives, including compliance.
Compliance risks are those risks relating to possible
violations of applicable laws, regulations, contractual terms,
standards, or internal policies where such violation could
result in direct or indirect financial liability, civil or criminal
penalties, regulatory sanctions, or other negative effects for
the organization or its personnel. Throughout this publication,
“events” associated with compliance risks will be referred to
as “noncompliance” or “compliance violations.”
Although the underlying acts (or failures to act) are carried out
by individuals, compliance violations are generally attributable
to the organization when they are carried out by employees
or agents of the organization in the ordinary course of their
duties. The exact scope of acts attributable to an organization
can vary depending upon the circumstances. In some cases,
the employee may also bear liability as an individual.
Most compliance violations either inherently cause harm
or have the potential to result in direct harm to individuals,
communities, or organizations. Examples of parties that may
be harmed through compliance violations include customers
(e.g., violations of privacy or data security laws leading to
a breach and theft of personal information, product safety
violations resulting in injuries, antitrust violations resulting in
inflated prices), employees (e.g., workplace safety regulation
violations resulting in injury to a worker, antidiscrimination or
whistleblower protection law violations), or the general public
(e.g., environmental violations resulting in illness or death).
Although most compliance risks relate to specific laws or
regulations, others do not. These other risks, referred to as
“compliance-related risks,” may include risks associated
with failures to comply with professional standards, internal
policies of an organization (including codes of conduct and
business ethics), and contractual obligations. For example,
conflicts of interest represent violations of laws or regulations
only in limited instances (frequently involving government
officials or programs). Conflicts of interest are frequently
prohibited by professional standards, terms of contracts and
grant agreements, or internal policies, and they are viewed
as damaging to an organization if they are not disclosed and
managed. As a result, conflicts of interest are commonly
included within the population of compliance risks.
Accordingly, throughout this publication, the term
“compliance risk” is used in reference to any risk that
is either directly associated with a law or regulation or
is compliance-related in that it is associated with other
standards, organizational policies, or ethical expectations
and guidelines.
As this discussion illustrates, the scope of what an
organization considers to be compliance risks is not an
exact science, although most organizations use a similar
list of compliance risk areas within the universe of their
programs (e.g., environmental, bribery, and corruption), even
if the specific compliance risks within each area may differ.
Determining the exact scope of a C&E program is typically

## 1. INTRODUCTION

coso.org
2    |   Enterprise Risk Management   |  Compliance Risk Management: Applying the COSO ERM Framework
both an early step in developing the program and an
ongoing exercise as the risk landscape changes, and input
from compliance, legal, senior leaders, and the board are
considered.
Compliance violations often result in fines, penalties, civil
settlements, or similar financial liabilities. However, not all
compliance violations have direct financial ramifications. In
some cases, the initial impact may be purely reputational.
However, reputational damage often leads to future financial
or nonfinancial harm, ranging from loss of customers to loss of
employees, competitive disadvantages, or other effects (e.g.,
suspension, debarment).
Most noncompliance stems from actions taken by insiders
– employees, management, or members of an organization’s
board of directors. Increasingly, risks also result from
contractors and other third parties whose actions affect an
organization. The most common examples involve vendors
in an organization’s supply chain (e.g., when a supplier of
Egyptian cotton bedding for several major retailers was found
to be using a lesser grade of cotton that was not from Egypt,
the retailers incurred significant liabilities to their customers)
or third parties involved in the sales cycle (e.g., intermediaries
that may pay bribes to government officials in order to obtain
lucrative contracts for an organization).
A final consideration in determining the scope of a program
is the potential for inherited risks resulting from merger and
acquisition (M&A) activity. As M&A transactions take place,
the universe of compliance risks to which an organization is
exposed can change drastically and instantly. These risks may
relate to events that took place prior to the merger or may
simply result from unique risks faced by the merged entity that
the acquiror had not previously faced.
The evolution of compliance and ethics programs
Although compliance with laws and regulations has been
an expectation for many years, compliance and ethics as
a profession and as a distinct function in organizations is a
relatively recent development. It stems from the equally recent
emergence of the C&E program as a valuable and frequently
required element of organizational management.
A series of events in the 1980s in the United States led to

## the U.S. Sentencing Commission publishing guidelines in

1991 for the punishment of organizations for violations of
the law. Among its provisions, the sentencing guidelines for
organizations provide for very significant reductions in criminal
penalties if an organization has an effective compliance
program in place. Important amendments were made in 2004
and 2010 to clarify and expand on the characteristics of an
effective program.
The current U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines (USSG) identify
the following seven elements of an effective C&E program:
1  Standards and procedures
2  Governance, oversight, and authority
3  Due diligence in delegation of authority
4  Communication and training
5  Monitoring, auditing, and reporting systems
6  Incentives and enforcement
7  Response to wrongdoing
Separately, the USSG also require that organizations
periodically assess the risk of noncompliance and continually
look for ways to improve their C&E programs. This two-part
requirement has often been referred to as the eighth element
of an effective program. Each of these elements is explained in
greater detail in Appendix 1.
The USSG also state that organizations should promote a
culture that encourages ethical conduct and a commitment
to compliance with the law. This acknowledgment that
organizational culture and business ethics play integral roles
in compliance risk management is one of the factors that led to
the common use of the term “compliance and ethics program”
or “C&E program”.
The USSG do not mandate C&E programs for any organization;
however, they provide an incentive for the establishment
of such programs as a means of mitigating the significant
penalties that can otherwise result when an organization is
found to have violated federal laws. In criminal cases involving
noncompliance with laws, an organization’s penalty can be
decreased significantly from a base amount determined, in
part, on the existence of an effective C&E program. Developing
case law related to the guidelines has added further weight
to the importance of C&E programs, particularly in highly
regulated entities, with courts concluding that the failure to
implement an effective C&E program may represent a breach
of fiduciary duty. Additionally, guidance issued by the U.S.
Department of Justice and other agencies have emphasized
the importance of C&E programs.
Although the USSG don’t require organizations to have C&E
programs, individual government agencies sometimes do.
For example, certain healthcare organizations must have
compliance programs as a condition for eligibility to participate

## in Medicare, and the Federal Acquisition Regulations require

certain government contractors to have compliance programs.

Finally, a compliance department should be separate from the
legal and regulatory affairs department. This independence
is not generally required, but is rapidly emerging as a
preferred practice due to the differing and sometimes
conflicting responsibilities of the two functions. For example,

## guidance issued by the Office of Inspector General of

## the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS

OIG) indicates that the compliance department should be

## independent. In its 2012 A Toolkit for Health Care Boards, the

## HHS OIG’s Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement

Action Team (HEAT) stated: “Protect the compliance officer’s
independence by separating this role from your legal
counsel and senior management. All decisions affecting the
compliance officer’s employment or limiting the scope of the
compliance program should require prior board approval.”
International guidance on compliance and ethics
programs
Although the most extensive statutory, regulatory, and
nonregulatory guidance on C&E programs has emanated from
the United States, many other countries have issued various
forms of requirements for and guidance on C&E programs. In
some instances, guidance on C&E programs outside the U.S.
is limited in application to specific areas of the law, such as
bribery and corruption or antitrust/competition. In others, it is
broader, like it is in the U.S., and applicable to many areas of
the law. Much of the guidance issued globally mirrors many of
the concepts and elements described in the USSG.
A sampling of some of the guidance from outside the U.S.
reveals a mostly consistent picture of what regulators expect
from C&E programs. For example, the United Kingdom’s

## Ministry of Justice has provided guidance on the Bribery Act

2010, describing procedures that commercial organizations
can put in place to minimize the risk of bribery. Those
procedures are summarized into the following six principles,
which that closely align with the USSG:
1  Proportionate procedures
2  Top-level commitment
3  Risk assessment
4  Due diligence
5  Communication (including training)
6  Monitoring and review
Guidance has also been issued by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO). Its 2016 ISO 37001 Anti-
bribery management systems standard includes the following
expectations of a program:
1  Performance of a bribery risk assessment
2  Leadership and commitment to the anti-bribery
management system
3  Establishment of an anti-bribery compliance function
4  Sufficient resources provided for the anti-bribery
management system
5  Competence of employees
6  Awareness and training on anti-bribery policies
7  Due diligence in connection with third-party business
associates and employees
8  Establishment and implementation of anti-bribery
controls
9  Internal audit of the anti-bribery management system
10  Periodic reviews of the anti-bribery management system
by the governing body
Beyond bribery, ISO has also issued guidance more broadly
on compliance management systems in the form of ISO
19600:2014. Most recently, ISO/DIS 37301 was proposed in 2020
to replace ISO 19600. The draft new standard describes the
following five elements of a compliance management system:
1  Compliance obligations (identification of new and
changed compliance requirements)
2  Compliance risk assessment
3  Compliance policy
4  Training and communication
5  Performance evaluation
A variety of other legal and regulatory developments that
do not directly reference C&E programs nonetheless affect
them. For example, 2019 European Union regulations aimed
at providing new protections for whistleblowers help in
supporting an important element of an effective C&E program.
Similarly, data protection and privacy laws commonly differ
from one country to another, but frequently have direct or
indirect effects on C&E programs.
Additional examples of international guidance on C&E
programs are provided in Appendix 2. What it shows is that
global guidance on C&E programs has far more similarities than

coso.org
4    |   Enterprise Risk Management   |  Compliance Risk Management: Applying the COSO ERM Framework
differences, even if the scope of application of a C&E program
may differ (i.e., limited to bribery and corruption in some
jurisdictions and broader application in others). The common
thread across these various guides is a shared appreciation
for the elements on which this COSO guide is based.
The relationship between compliance, internal
control, and enterprise risk management
COSO defines internal control in Internal Control – Integrated

## Framework (2013) and Enterprise Risk Management –

## Integrating with Strategy and Performance (2017) as follows:

A process, effected by an entity’s board of directors,
management, and other personnel, designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
achievement of objectives relating
to operations, reporting, and compliance.
As this definition clearly points out, internal control is not
solely about accounting and financial matters. Compliance
with laws and regulations is one of the three fundamental
objectives of an organization’s system of internal controls.
The following five components of internal control support all
three categories of objectives:
• Control environment
• Risk assessment
• Control activities
• Information and communication
• Monitoring activities
The relationships between the three objectives, five
components, and the entity are depicted in figure 1.1:

COSO defines ERM as follows:
The culture, capabilities, and practices, integrated
with strategy-setting and its performance, that
organizations rely on to manage risk in creating,
preserving, and realizing value.
The COSO ERM framework, like the internal control
framework, comprises five interrelated components:
Governance & culture
Strategy & objective-setting
Performance
Review and revision

ERM is different than, but related to, internal controls. ERM
incorporates some of the concepts of internal control. In
fact, implementation of internal controls is the most common
approach to reducing risk. But ERM also includes certain
concepts that are not considered within internal control. For
example, concepts of risk appetite, tolerance, strategy, and
business objectives are set within ERM, but are viewed as
preconditions of internal control. ERM is more closely aligned
with strategy than internal control.
An important aspect of ERM is its focus on creating,
preserving, and realizing value. The C&E program supports
each of these three goals. An effective C&E program
allows an organization to more confidently pursue new
value creation opportunities. Further, value that has been
created by an organization can quickly become impaired
when accompanied by violations of laws or regulations. An
effective C&E program can preserve this value and enable an
organization to fully realize it.
Accordingly, the management of compliance risk is an
important element of both the internal control and the
broader ERM functions and processes of an organization.
The scope and positioning of the compliance
function in an organization
As noted earlier, compliance risk generally involves the risk
of violations of laws and regulations, but it may also address
contract provisions, professional standards, organizational
policy, and ethics matters. The laws and regulations that
fall within the scope of a compliance program, however,
can vary by industry and from organization to organization.
For example, risk of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act may fall clearly within the scope of a company’s C&E
program. But compliance with accounting standards

## required in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange

Commission may be addressed within the accounting and
finance functions and may be considered outside the scope
of the C&E program. Human resources and employment law
risks may be managed entirely within the human resources
function, or the compliance function may also participate in
managing these risks.
There is not a universally accepted definition for the
scope of an organization’s C&E program. It can vary from
one organization to another. As a result, compliance with
some laws and regulations may be primarily subject to the
oversight of others, although the compliance function should
always be prepared to serve an overarching role or to step
in to assist or address issues if the others are unable or
unwilling to properly manage the risk.
Another difference among organizations may involve where
the compliance function “sits” within the organization.
Although a C&E program is organization-wide, involving
employees and managers from all functional areas, the
compliance function, consisting of a dedicated team of
compliance and ethics professionals, may be positioned in
a variety of locations within an organization chart. In most
organizations, it is an independent function, and this is
considered the best practice. In others, it may be a part of, or
report to, legal, internal audit, risk management, or another
function. Regardless of where the compliance function is
positioned on an organization chart, communication and
collaboration with each of the preceding functions are
essential to the success of a C&E program.
Likewise, ethics may be considered a function apart from
compliance. In many organizations, however, compliance
and ethics fall under a compliance and ethics officer.
It is important to understand that although virtually every
employee plays a role in managing risk, the management/
mitigation of compliance risk is primarily the responsibility of
all management at all levels. The compliance function leads
the development of the C&E program, but it is ultimately
management’s job to execute the program and for the board
to provide oversight. The role of the compliance and ethics
officer is to help management understand the risks; lead the
development of the program to mitigate and manage those
risks; evaluate how well the program is being executed;
and report to leadership on gaps in coverage, execution,
or material instances of noncompliance, including those by
senior leaders.
In summary, management of compliance risk can be
performed effectively under a variety of structural models.
This publication provides guidance on the design and
operation of an effective C&E program regardless of the
organizational structure or how responsibilities are allocated.

About this Guidance
There are several target audiences for this publication,
including the following:
1  Professionals such as risk managers, internal
auditors, and others who are involved in applying an
organization’s ERM program to compliance risks.
2  Compliance professionals who are aiming to align
their C&E program to, or integrate it with,
an organization-wide ERM program.
3  The senior management team, to better
understand compliance risk and the C&E program.
4  Members of the board of directors, to assist them
in their oversight role.

## When the USSG were developed, and as the elements of

effective C&E programs have evolved, fitting the seven
elements within the ERM framework was not a significant
concern or objective. Indeed, much of this evolution
occurred before the first ERM framework was published by
COSO in 2004.
In the remaining portions of this guide, each of the 20
principles of the COSO ERM framework, depicted in figure
1.3, is mapped to the specific requirements and emerging
practices of an effective C&E program. Section 2 starts with
the governance and culture component and the related
five principles. Sections 3 to 6 cover the other components
and their related principles, respectively. In each, key steps
are provided to implement and maintain an effective C&E
program for each of the ERM principles.

This section describes the application of the governance

## and culture component of the COSO ERM framework to the

management of compliance risks. The COSO framework
describes the following five principles that underlie this
component:
1  Exercises board risk oversight
2  Establishes operating structures
3  Defines desired culture
4  Demonstrates commitment to core values
5  Attracts, develops, and retains capable individuals
Principle 1 – Exercises board risk oversight
The board of directors is responsible for oversight of the
organization’s C&E program, and management is responsible
for the design and operation of the program. The expectation
of board oversight is reinforced in C&E program standards that
have been promulgated in several countries. For instance, the
USSG § 8B2.1(b)(2)(A)-(C) state that a company’s “governing
authority shall be knowledgeable about the content and
operation of the compliance and ethics program and shall
exercise reasonable oversight.”
Given the possible complexity of an organization’s C&E program,
it is often advisable for the board to delegate responsibility for
this oversight to a board-level standing committee, much like
audit oversight is commonly delegated to an audit committee.
This enables a committee to devote sufficient time to oversight
— time that may be unavailable for the entire board. As noted
earlier, the term “board” is used in reference to either the board
of directors or a board-level committee that has oversight
responsibility for the C&E program.
For oversight to be exercised properly, there must be an
open and direct line of communication between the CCO
and the board. This communication should include regularly
scheduled, periodic meetings, including sessions in which the
board meets privately with the CCO without other members of
senior management present.
Having compliance expertise on the board can be extremely
valuable and can enhance oversight of the program. Ideally,
this expertise comes from industry-specific experience with
relevant compliance issues as well as experience developing
and managing effective compliance programs.
The board should also ensure there is an effective
compliance oversight infrastructure in place to support the
C&E program, to include adequate staffing and resources,
as well as appropriate authority and empowerment to
achieve the objectives of the program. This infrastructure
may also include an internal compliance committee. Often,
an internal compliance committee composed of individuals
from key functions or business units is an effective way
for the CCO to maintain open lines of communication to
facilitate timely awareness of emerging compliance risk
areas and to obtain important input and buy-in on how to
mitigate and address risks.

• Establish protocol/procedures for escalation of significant compliance risk events
Principle 2 — Establishes operating structures
The positioning of the compliance function within an
organization has important implications for the effectiveness
of the program. The compliance function should be led by
someone who is positioned to be effective, which typically
means being a peer of other senior leaders. Moreover, the
compliance function must have the practical authority,
resources, and tools to effectively fulfill its mandate. Finally,
the compliance function should be functionally separate
and distinct from other functions, particularly those that are
frequently perceived by regulators as having conflicting
obligations or priorities (e.g., legal, finance, etc.). Although
it may be possible for the compliance and ethics function
to be effective when housed within other departments,
the preferred practice is for compliance to be functionally
separate and — like internal audit — report to the board. If
the function does not report to the board, extra care must be
taken to ensure adequate resources and sufficient autonomy,
including direct and unfiltered access to the board.
Operating structure should also include documented policies
and procedures covering the governance and decision-
making processes associated with the C&E program. From
a governance standpoint, if oversight of the C&E program
has been delegated by the board of directors to a board-
level compliance committee, the committee should operate
in accordance with a board-approved charter. The charter
describes in detail the responsibilities and key operating
procedures of the committee (e.g., frequency and nature of
meetings, reporting to the board) as well as the qualifications
for committee members.
Increasingly, regulators and the enforcement community
consider the stature of the compliance function relative to
other executive functions as a signal of how seriously the C&E
program, and therefore compliance with laws and regulations,
is viewed within an organization. Is the compliance function
buried several layers down the organization chart? Or is
it represented at a very high executive level? Stature also
considers positioning of the CCO relative to other senior
executives of an organization.
Operating structure should also include other key compliance
policies and procedures, such as those that govern
the methodology and performance of compliance risk
assessments, consideration of forming an internal compliance
committee with representation from across the organization,
and procedures for escalation when significant risk events
occur, among other procedures.
Principle 3 — Defines desired culture
It is critical for the organization to establish and maintain a
culture of compliance and integrity. Without it, even the most
carefully designed compliance controls will be vulnerable
to failure. Culture begins with a sincere commitment
to compliance and ethics at the leadership level. The
commitment is reflected in several ways, beginning with its
inclusion in a code of conduct or business ethics that is written
in a manner that clearly articulates expectations of behavior.
Leadership can also reinforce and clarify this culture through
other communications. This commitment to culture should be
further reflected through the adoption of important compliance
metrics and by meaningfully incorporating compliance into
the performance evaluation and compensation/incentive
compensation processes, particularly at leadership levels.
An exercise that is helpful in setting expectations for culture is
for senior management to have a robust discussion about the
relationship between compliance risk and the organization’s
risk appetite and risk tolerance, which are discussed further
in the next section. In particular, tolerance, which considers
acceptable levels of variation in performance related to
achieving business objectives, should consider the potential
impact of compliance risk, because compliance with laws,
regulations, and other requirements should itself be one of the
primary business objectives for all organizations.
Another aspect in a culture of compliance is that of risk
awareness. It is one thing to have a culture in which
compliance is important. But an essential element of such an
environment is a culture of risk awareness, where employees
are vigilant and willing to raise concerns when they see
warning signs of risk.

coso.org
Enterprise Risk Management   |  Compliance Risk Management: Applying the COSO ERM Framework   |    9
Communication and training are also important tools for
promoting an ethical culture, because each reinforces
an overall mindset of compliance and integrity, while also
improving awareness of key compliance issues. Accordingly,
training should include periodic discussion of the code
of conduct, but it should also include training on specific
compliance issues tailored to individual groups of employees
exposed to these risks in connection with their work.
Principle 4 — Demonstrates commitment to
core values
Commitment to core values should be represented in a value
statement or other set of guiding principles that demonstrates
a commitment to compliance and ethical business conduct.
Increasingly, studies show a correlation between ethical
culture and organizational performance, consistent with ERM’s
goal of creating value.
The tone from the top plays an important role in managing
compliance risks. The tone set by the executive team must
set an example of compliance and ethical behavior. This
commitment must cascade throughout the organization, thus
the term tone “from” the top rather than tone “at” the top.
Each layer of leaders within an organization — the supervisors
and managers of others — must communicate and pass this
tone on to the next level.
Commitment to compliance and ethics, however, requires
much more than setting the tone. Employees should be held
accountable for their individual roles in managing compliance
risks, and this should be reflected in job descriptions,
performance evaluations, and incentives.
When allegations of noncompliance or unethical behavior
emerge, they must be taken seriously. This means that
individuals should be required to report wrongdoing and have
multiple avenues for reporting. Once an allegation is received,
sound investigative protocols should be followed in a timely
manner to assess the credibility of the allegation. In addition,
individuals who report concerns about wrongdoing must feel
safe speaking up and be protected from retaliation in order for
this system to operate effectively.
If wrongdoing is confirmed through the investigative process,
disciplinary action should be taken in a degree that is
appropriate to the level of wrongdoing. Discipline should be
consistent based on the nature of the wrongdoing, without
regard to the individual’s level on the organization chart or
level of influence within the organization.

Principle 5 — Attracts, develops, and retains
capable individuals
An effective compliance function should be led by a CCO with
appropriate experience and qualifications. The specifics of
prior experience and other qualifications can vary based on
the nature of the organization, its industry, and many other
factors.
Throughout the entire organization, hiring individuals who
respect compliance and make business decisions in an
ethical manner is vital to the management of compliance risks.
Indeed, being perceived as an organization that is committed
to compliance and ethics helps companies attract and retain
good people.
The USSG, which established the framework for what has
become the global standard for C&E programs, state that
an “organization shall use reasonable efforts not to include
within the substantial authority personnel of the organization
any individual whom the organization knew, or should
have known through the exercise of due diligence, has
engaged in illegal activities or other conduct inconsistent
with an effective compliance and ethics program.” As such,
organizations should perform background checks appropriate

## to the responsibilities of the position and in compliance with

relevant employment laws. The CCO may collaborate with
human resources and others to identify positions considered
to involve “substantial authority”— those that could create
compliance risk for the organization.
The COSO ERM framework indicates that performance
evaluation and the establishment of appropriate incentives
are two important ingredients for developing and retaining
individuals. These tools are critical for the management of
compliance risks as well. The Department of Justice (DOJ)
notes that a “hallmark of effective implementation of a
compliance program is the establishment of incentives for
compliance and disincentives for non-compliance.”
Just as training on a code of conduct and broad ethical issues
helps to define an organization’s desired culture (Principle 3),
training on specific compliance risk topics further develops
individuals’ abilities to effectively recognize and manage
compliance risks. Furthermore, the compliance team itself
should continue to be developed with training on emerging
practices for managing a C&E program and changes in the
legal/regulatory environment.
In recent years, numerous compliance issues have been
triggered by third parties (nonemployees), especially those
that play integral roles in connection with supply chains,
sales, delivery, and other key functions. Accordingly, the due
diligence concepts described in this section should also be
applied when engaging third parties to carry out activities
on behalf of the organization (e.g., suppliers, sales agents,
outsourcing partners), based on the level of compliance risk
associated with each third party. The degree of background
checking, other due diligence, and compliance-related
performance measures should vary based on the assessed
level of risk, and due diligence should be repeated periodically
as part of maintaining ongoing relationships with high-risk third
parties. Due diligence in engaging with certain third parties,
as well as ongoing training and monitoring of compliance
performance of third parties, have become expected by
regulators and are integral elements of this principle.

Enterprise Risk Management   |  Compliance Risk Management: Applying the COSO ERM Framework   |    11
This section describes the application of the strategy and
objective-setting component of the COSO ERM framework, and
the following four principles associated with the management
of compliance risks:
6  Analyzes business context
7  Defines risk appetite
8  Evaluates alternative strategies
9  Formulates business objectives
Principle 6 — Analyzes business context
Context is critical to understanding and managing
compliance risks. Business decision-making is one of the
drivers of compliance risk; decisions can create new risks,
change existing risks, or eliminate risks. Accordingly, the
identification of a compliance risk universe should consider
the organization’s evolving strategy. The CCO should have
an appropriate level of involvement in the strategy-setting
process to enable the compliance function to be positioned
to identify and develop plans to manage compliance risks that
emerge from changes in strategy. Likewise, the CCO should
be informed of sudden shifts in strategy that may occur as an
organization responds to changes in its environment.
Context for effective compliance risk management includes
consideration of other internal drivers of compliance risk —
factors that can create new risks or change existing ones.
Some of the most important internal drivers of compliance
risk include changes in people, processes, and technology.
Another driver of compliance risk is management pressure,
particularly when such pressure is not coupled with reminders
regarding the expectation of compliance and appropriate
incentives to adhere to the C&E program. More broadly,
changes in organizational culture can arise from many factors
and can affect compliance risk.
External drivers of compliance risk also represent an important
element of context in identifying and managing compliance
risks. The most obvious external factors are those involving the
legal, regulatory, and enforcement landscape. For example,
recent changes in data privacy and security laws have
created entirely new compliance risks for some organizations.
External drivers also include competitive, economic, and other
factors that may directly or indirectly affect compliance risk.
External factors may be at a macro level (e.g., industrywide
competition, economic conditions) or at a micro level (e.g.,
changes in local or regional laws and regulations).
Risk interdependencies may also affect how an organization
manages compliance risks. An organization’s responses to
other risks (e.g., strategic, financial) may affect compliance
risk in a positive or adverse way.

Table 3.2  Defines risk appetite
Key
characteristics
• Consider compliance risk as part of the organization’s risk profile in determining risk appetite
• Consider compliance risk by (1) type of risk (e.g., anti-bribery), (2) business unit or organizational function
(e.g., human resources), and (3) location or region
• Determine and evaluate the relationships between compliance risks and the achievement of business
objectives
• Discuss risk appetite on a regular basis and update as necessary based on changes in compliance risk
• Consider developing specific risk-centric appetite statements associated with compliance risks in support of
organizational risk appetite and tolerance
Principle 7 — Defines risk appetite
For those not familiar with the term, appetite for compliance risk
often conjures up images of organizations willfully accepting
known compliance violations. The very nature of compliance risk
means that a law may be violated that could result in financial
or nonfinancial consequences for the organization (e.g., fines,
suspension or debarment, reputational damage). The level of
acceptance of compliance risk in the pursuit of business goals
and objectives is a topic for discussion among management
and the board (being clear to point out that this discussion is not
related to accepting known violations; it is about the realistic
assumption that it is impossible to eliminate the possibility of a
noncompliance event).
As defined by COSO, risk appetite refers to the types and
amount of risk, on a broad level, that the organization is
willing to accept in pursuit of value. Neither appetite nor risk
tolerance — the acceptable levels of variation in performance
related to business objectives — is typically defined at the
risk-specific level.
Although neither appetite nor tolerance are expressed in
terms of compliance risk, there may be separate risk-centric
statements relating to individual compliance risk areas. More
commonly, the potential impact of compliance risk on the
achievement of business objectives should be considered in
relation to determining and stating risk appetite and tolerance.
As noted earlier, compliance with laws, regulations, and
other requirements should itself be considered as a business
objective of the organization.
A practical way of viewing compliance risk and its relationship
to risk appetite and tolerance is by viewing it at the business
unit or location level and by type of compliance risk. At the
business unit (or functional) level, each group often has its own
unique compliance risks, each with vastly different potential
consequences for violations. For example, an international
bribery violation may result in much more significant financial
penalties than a building code violation.
Although a fire code violation may trigger only a rather
small fine, however, the potential consequences of a fire
code violation tragically resulting in the loss of life could be
enormous. Seemingly immaterial compliance risks like this
building code violation could lead to other risks, such as a
request for a bribe from a building inspector. Examining risk
appetite with consideration for the full range of potential
consequences is an important element of compliance risk
management.
As noted in COSO’s May 2020 publication, Risk Appetite –

## Critical to Success: Using Risk Appetite to Thrive in a Changing

World, three of the inputs to risk appetite are as follows:

## 1. Board and management perspectives on appetite

## 2. Understanding the existing risk profile

## 3. Organizational culture

Board and management perspective on risk appetite should
be framed, in part, on a consideration of the relationships
between compliance risk and the achievement of business
objectives. This can be achieved only if the board and
management have a sufficient understanding of compliance
risk as a component of the organization’s overall risk profile.
Similarly, as noted earlier, maintaining a culture of compliance
is an essential element of a C&E program and, therefore,
should be considered in developing an organization-wide
appetite for risk in general.
Understanding how much of a threat a compliance risk poses
to the achievement of business objectives enables the CCO
to effectively prioritize the deployment of preventive and
detective resources. For example, if an organization has
determined that a particular category of compliance risk poses
a significant threat to the achievement of business objectives,
the organization may allocate greater resources to managing
that risk. More attention may be devoted to auditing and
monitoring in this area, among other possible responses.
Organizations must also recognize that they cannot
realistically eliminate all compliance risks or reduce the
likelihood of occurrence to zero. This is simply not possible. As
a result, engaging in discussions about risk appetite relating
to compliance risks is a valuable tool in prioritizing efforts
aimed at prevention and detection of specific compliance
violations. Guidance from regulators is consistent with this
concept: expecting organizations to reduce and manage, not
necessarily eliminate, compliance risk.

Principle 8 — Evaluates alternative strategies
The compliance function should be involved in strategy
discussions from the standpoint of (1) understanding the
strategy so that the C&E program can be designed to
manage compliance risks appropriately and (2) advising
strategic decision makers about possible compliance risks
associated with strategies under consideration. Compliance
risk assessment and management are most effective when
the compliance function is fully informed prior to embarking
on new strategic initiatives, enabling the C&E program to be
prepared to proactively address new or changing compliance
risks. The CCO should also play a role in developing new
compliance risk mitigation approaches in the context of
changing strategies and risk appetite, as well as assistance in
evaluating compliance risk issues associated with alternative
strategies under consideration.
If strategic decisions made by an organization involve merger
or acquisition activities, it is important for compliance to be
involved early in the process so that appropriate due diligence
focusing on compliance risks can be performed. This due
diligence is important to the decision-making process for
mergers and acquisitions in order to understand the level of
risk that may be inherited as a result of the transaction, as well
as any C&E program integration needs and risks that may need
to be addressed.
Once strategy has been decided, the compliance function
should identify and understand the implications for
the organization’s C&E program. Begin by identifying
and assessing compliance risks, as well as suggesting
modifications to internal controls aimed at mitigating
compliance risk. Consider changes to training, monitoring, and
auditing plans for the C&E program, and the development of
key compliance metrics or performance indicators.
As a strategy is being implemented, the organization may
continue to make changes to the strategy based on an
assessment of its successes and failures. This assessment
is another opportunity for the CCO to provide valuable input
based on the C&E program’s monitoring and auditing activities,
which may have revealed a level of compliance risk that differs
from what was initially expected.
Table 3.3  Evaluates alternative strategies
Key
characteristics
• Ensure that the CCO has a seat at the table in discussions of strategies
• Solicit input and insight from the CCO regarding how strategy affects compliance risk
• Perform risk-based due diligence on merger and acquisition targets prior to execution of the transaction

C&E program

Principle 9 — Formulates business objectives
Linked to strategy, business objectives are measurable criteria
by which the organization and individual business units can
be evaluated. Much like how adoption of strategy can affect
compliance risk, development of business objectives also
often creates or affects the likelihood of compliance violations.
Additionally, complying with applicable laws, regulations,
contract terms, and other requirements should be considered
as its own business objective if compliance is not explicitly
addressed through other stated business objectives.
Sometimes, performance metrics developed for business units
can inadvertently create incentives to violate compliance
requirements. Take the simple example of a manufacturing
facility whose personnel are incentivized by aggressive
new goals for increased production. This goal could lead
to shortcuts in quality control and inspections, resulting in
product safety violations if the production team views violating
these compliance requirements as an acceptable means of
achieving the new targets. The compliance function should be
consulted as part of the establishment of business objectives,
in much the same manner as described in Principle 8, to
ensure that incentives are appropriately structured to minimize
the promotion of bad behavior or that such incentives are
balanced with appropriate compliance incentives. Ideally,
compliance participates in the establishment of business
objectives, but at a minimum, it is well informed of such
objectives and the performance metrics that are used for
individual evaluations.
Risk interactions should also be considered. As business
objectives and performance metrics change in one area of the
organization, compliance risks may be affected — either in the
same business unit or in other areas of the organization.
Finally, just as performance metrics are an essential
characteristic for business units, the compliance function
itself should develop and monitor performance metrics. These
metrics address and measure how well the C&E program and
infrastructure is working in practice across the organization,
and its overall effectiveness. Examples of measurable metrics
— and key performance indicators (KPIs) — include such
things as training completion rates, timeliness of responding
to issues, investigations, and implementing corrective action
plans, volume, frequency, and types of issues reported through
the organizations’ reporting mechanisms, culture survey
responses over time, and metrics from monitoring various
internal compliance controls such as vendor payments in
high-risk operating locations. Although not all areas of the
C&E program are easy to objectively measure, the compliance
function should take steps to develop and monitor objective
metrics wherever possible.

incentive and other compensation decisions

Enterprise Risk Management   |  Compliance Risk Management: Applying the COSO ERM Framework   |    15
This section describes the application of the performance
component of the COSO ERM framework and the following
five principles associated with the management of
compliance risks:
10 Identifies risk
11  Assesses severity of risk
12  Prioritizes risk
13  Implements risk responses
14  Develops portfolio view
For C&E programs to be effective, it is expected by
regulators and others that organizations periodically
assess the potential threats of legal, regulatory, and policy
noncompliance, as well as ethical misconduct, so that
the organization can take steps to manage these risks to
acceptable levels.
Principle 10 — Identifies risk
One of the most challenging tasks for the C&E program is
the identification of the myriad compliance risks faced by
the organization. Organizations are subject to thousands of
laws and regulations ranging from antitrust, privacy, fraud,
and intellectual property rights/obligations to local sales
tax, licensing requirements, and environmental standards.
Further, these threats constantly change with new and
altered legal and regulatory requirements; with shifts in
organizational strategies, such as a retailer entering the
business of health care services; and with the emergence of
new compliance risks as societal values evolve. To function
effectively, the C&E program needs to have processes in
place to identify and track these various risks across the
organization.
Historically, many organizations approached compliance
with laws and regulations in silos, developing programs to
address specific issues where the organization or others
in the industry had encountered significant challenges. For
example, the business unit directly involved with the risk,
such as antitrust or environmental or money laundering,
would be responsible for most, if not all, aspects of
compliance with those laws. As compliance programs have
matured, they have moved to a more integrative, proactive
approach based not on a particular past crisis that the
organization wishes to avoid repeating, but on the systematic
assessment of the organization and its environment to
identify current and future threats to compliance. This same
motive is what drives organizations to implement ERM.
Not all compliance threats will be considered priorities in
the ERM context. For example, of the 10 most significant
compliance risks identified by the C&E program, perhaps
only 2 or 3 of them will be among the 10 most important
identified by the ERM function at the organizational level,
after consolidating compliance risks with all other risks.
Yet for the C&E program, these are important, because
they can emerge as serious threats through their impact
on the compliance culture. Regulators expect a specific
assessment of compliance risks as part of the C&E program.
This suggests that even when an organization has a mature,
well-developed ERM program, the C&E program should
supplement the organizational-level ERM and should strive
to identify and manage all compliance risks, regardless of
whether all are material at the enterprise level.
Developing a risk inventory for compliance risk is similar
to the process of developing the ERM risk inventory. As
illustrated in figure 4.1, there are a number of approaches
that can be taken, with some approaches being more
effective in identifying new and emerging risks.
For compliance risk identification, some approaches have
been found to be particularly useful. Many organizations
start with a risk inventory identified by similarly situated
organizations or industry associations. This inventory needs
to be viewed as a starting place and should then be tailored
to the organization, considering its unique operations.
Another often-used approach is to interview key employees
to better understand operations and determine applicable
laws and regulations that they deal with on a regular basis.
As noted in figure 4.1, this method is effective at identifying
existing laws and regulations posing compliance risks and

may provide an indicator of emerging risk, but it may not be
as effective at identifying new risks or changing enforcement
standards not yet apparent to employees. Surveys may also
be used to ask key managers to identify applicable laws and
regulations that they deal with regularly in their area.1
Regardless of the approaches taken, the variety and
complexity of compliance risks create the need for
operations managers and risk owners to be involved in the
risk-identification process. One way of doing this is the
development of compliance committees at various levels in the
organization. Senior management and the board must also be
involved by including the C&E program leadership in strategic
planning so they can understand the organization’s current
and evolving strategies and the related compliance risk.
Information provided by regulators can also be helpful in
identifying new and emerging risk, because many of these
agencies issue alerts regarding where they see emerging
risks and have compliance concerns. For example, the SEC

## Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations issues

special risk alerts, and the HHS OIG publishes its work plan
to alert organizations to areas considered to be high risk.
Further, compliance risk extends beyond the legal boundaries
of the organization. Third-party contractors, suppliers,
and partners in strategic alliances can pose significant
compliance and ethical risks. Concerns specifically related
to third-party risks include the following:

## 1. The organization usually has a lessened ability to

control or oversee the work of a third party than it
would with its own employees.

## 2. Third parties often do not have as strong of an

incentive to adhere to compliance and ethics
expectations as employees do.

## 3. Third parties may operate in geographic areas that

are distant from the organization’s headquarters,
sometimes with differing laws, norms, and customs.
For these reasons, assessing risk involving third parties can
be complicated, but risk assessments should be performed at
the time a third party is engaged and periodically thereafter.
The extent of each risk assessment, due diligence process,
and subsequent monitoring and auditing should consider the
role the third party plays, materiality, and other factors that
could affect the level of risk associated with each third party.
Not all compliance risks will rise to the entity level and
appear in the ERM risk register; however, the risk of
regulatory change would be included in such an entity-level
inventory in most organizations.

Principle 11 — Assesses severity of risk
Severity of a compliance risk is usually assessed primarily on
the basis of likelihood and impact. Other factors may also be
considered and will be explained later.
Likelihood is the probability that the risk could occur. In the
case of compliance, this means the probability of specific
noncompliance with a law/regulation or ethical misconduct.
Assessing the likelihood of compliance risk in most cases is
a subjective judgment. Despite being subjective, systematic
judgment can be made. One approach is to consider
the frequency of noncompliance. Will the event (e.g., a
salesperson making an illegal payment to a government
official to gain a contract) occur once a year or once every
five years? This judgment would be based on experience
or perhaps the organization’s historical data, if such data is
available. Another factor that enters into this assessment
is the organizational context. Typically, the assessor makes
assumptions about controls in place, such as policies
prohibiting such payments or the controls around the
payments process. In theory, one would like the assessment
to be made under the assumption of no controls at all being in
place, but it is difficult for people to imagine such “no control”
situations. They usually make the assessment assuming
“normal controls” or some sort of “minimal controls.” For
greater precision, some assessment methods break the
likelihood assessment in two parts: one for likelihood or
frequency and the other for effectiveness of internal controls,
as shown in figure 4.2. Some models may even consider
preventive and detective controls as two separate factors,
with preventive controls being more relevant to likelihood or
frequency, and detective controls more likely affecting the
impact of an event based on the timeliness of detection.
In figure 4.2, the likelihood of occurrence is measured on
a five-point scale from “rare” to “almost certain.” Control
assumptions and frequency are given descriptive anchors that
are then matched to the assessor’s beliefs.

This approach is just one example. Every organization should
customize its scale and measurement methodology to fit
its particular needs. This customization would be done by a
compliance committee or by the C&E program staff with input
from management. Once the scale is determined, it should be
applied consistently by the assessors.

The second component of risk severity is impact. Impact is the
result or effect of risk in terms of the organization’s strategy
and business objectives. With compliance risk, one thinks
immediately of civil and criminal fines and penalties, and the
possible direct financial consequences of noncompliance.
Another significant factor may be the reputational impact of
compliance and ethical issues. This and other consequences
(e.g., sanctions, suspension, and debarment) may have a
material indirect financial impact, as well as an impact on
morale and other factors that are difficult to measure.
Impact of noncompliance and ethical failures can be assessed
using a variety of measurement categories.
• Legal — Consisting of civil and criminal fines and penalties

• Financial — Internal and external costs associated
with investigating and remediation (e.g., legal fees,
consultants, investigators)
• Operational — Potential disruption of business operations
from plant shutdowns, suspensions, debarments, and loss
of license
• Reputation (image) — Effect of media coverage; damage
to organization’s image/brand; and subsequent diminished
attractiveness to current and potential future employees,
business partners, vendors, and customers
• Health and safety — Employee, patient, customer
• Ability to pursue strategic goals — Prohibition to added
new customers, loss of license
Figure 4.3 illustrates how these categories might be used to
construct a scale for assessing the impact of compliance risks.

As with the likelihood scale, each organization would adapt
the impact scale and factors to its own environmental context.
The organization’s risk appetite would also be reflected in
setting the values used in the anchor labels.
An additional factor that may enhance the evaluation of
severity is the localization or regionalization of the assessment.
For multilocation and multinational organizations, risk may vary
from one location or region to another, based on a wide variety
of factors. Rather than assessing severity at the organizational
level, determining separate measures can add an additional
level of precision to the assessment.
Assessment of each of the risks in the compliance risk
inventory can be made by compliance staff or by a compliance
committee and can be conducted at different levels of the
organization. In conducting assessments, steps should be
taken to minimize bias by avoiding self-assessment and using
multiple assessors from varied disciplines and experience to
ensure that risks are appropriately evaluated.

Principle 12 — Prioritizes risks
The assessments of compliance risks in terms of likelihood
and impact allow for prioritization across the organization.
One method used to capture and summarize the severity
assessment is to construct a risk inventory matrix.
Using the example scales from the preceding section, the
following matrix can be developed.

# IMPACT

This allows the organization to group risks in terms of how and
when they will be addressed and the level of attention that
each is given. Although it could be argued that the organization
ideally could address all of its compliance risks, from a practical
perspective, more direct and immediate attention is required
for the most serious risks. How this is done will depend on the
organization’s risk appetite and tolerances and its available
resources. For instance, in the example, risks in the green areas
would be periodically reassessed, but no specific risk response
action or extensive monitoring action would be taken. In the
yellow areas, the risk owners would be required to develop
a risk mitigation plan to reduce or eliminate them without the
addition of significant resources. For those risks falling in the
red areas, compliance committees would be assigned to work
with risk owners to develop detailed response plans in which
risk ownership is clearly identified, assign responsibility for risk
responses, and develop monitoring and auditing plans for the
remediation efforts.
In addition to severity and risk appetite, some organizations
consider other factors in their risk prioritization. Adjustments
might be made to the risks on the basis of velocity,
persistence, and recovery. Velocity is the speed at which a risk
affects the organization, such as a serious food safety violation
that would require immediate closure of a food processing
plant. Persistence is how long the risk affects the organization,
such as media coverage from criminal violations lasting four
or five years. Recovery refers to how long it takes to fix the
problem (i.e., time needed to manage the risk to tolerable
levels), such as how long it takes to implement improved
vendor due diligence criteria and processes to reduce the risk
of shell company transactions.
Table 4.2  Assesses severity of risk
Key
characteristics
• Adopt a uniform scale/scoring system for measuring severity of compliance risks
• Consider qualitative and quantitative measures
• Establish criteria to assess impact and likelihood of compliance risk event occurrence
• Assess severity of risk at different levels (organizational, regional, affiliate, etc.)
• Consider design and operation of internal controls intended to prevent or detect compliance risk events
• Minimize bias and inadequate knowledge in assessing severity (e.g., minimize self-assessments, use
multidisciplinary teams)
Table 4.3  Prioritizes risks
Key
characteristics
• Prioritize compliance risks based on assessed level of risk relative to meeting of business objectives
• Use objective scoring based on assessment
• Consider use of other assessment criteria (trend, velocity, etc.) in prioritizing compliance risks
• Consider possible effects of planned changes in strategy and operations
• Develop risk-based action plans for mitigation (risk responses, implemented in next step)
Principle 13 — Implements risk responses
Risk responses are designed to manage the assessed level
of risk and can take many forms. The most obvious response
to an elevated level of risk is the design and implementation
of improved internal controls over compliance. Effective
mitigation of a compliance risk involves consideration of all
seven elements of a C&E program for each risk (e.g., policies,
training).
Many risk-specific policies involve internal controls. Internal
controls over compliance may be preventive or detective
in nature, and ideally a blend of both is in place. Although

coso.org
20    |   Enterprise Risk Management   |  Compliance Risk Management: Applying the COSO ERM Framework
prevention of noncompliance and ethical misconduct is
preferred, there may be practical considerations that result
in an organization relying more heavily on timely detective
controls for certain risks.
Effective improvement of internal controls requires an
understanding of the principal drivers of a particular risk.
If the likelihood or frequency of a risk drove the assessed
severity higher, improvements to preventive controls may be
particularly important. On the other hand, impact — especially
when impact correlates to how long a risk goes undetected —
may be mitigated by improving detective controls.
Risk responses may involve many actions other than
improvements to procedural internal controls. For example,
targeted training aimed at areas of vulnerability may be useful.
Training is a form of internal control that is a particularly
valuable response when the design of procedural controls is
sound, but there are breakdowns in those controls based on a
lack of understanding of how the controls are to be applied or
a general lack of awareness of the controls.
Training may also be more general in nature. If the observed
behavior involves a weak culture of compliance, general
training on the importance of compliance may be useful.
Regardless of type, training, by itself, rarely results in
significant improvements. If coupled with improvements in
control processes, however, improvements are much more
likely to be observed.
Another possible risk response is to increase or improve
the auditing and monitoring function related to the specific
compliance risk assessed. This may be done through
increased frequency or scope of monitoring and auditing. Or
it may be achieved by implementing new methods of auditing
and monitoring. For example, increased use of data analytics
aimed at detecting red flags of noncompliance or red flags of
breakdowns in internal controls (also discussed in connection
with ERM Principle 18) can be powerful tools for the audit and
monitoring function.
One aspect of risk response worth further consideration is the
level of granularity of the response. Although some control
responses are very broad and apply to an entire process,
others may be much narrower. This is particularly pertinent
for the design of improved internal controls and certain
auditing and monitoring procedures. The assessment of risk
and controls may reveal a vulnerability in one very specific
part of a lengthy process. For example, an assessment of the
risk of product safety violations for a toy manufacturer might
reveal that new machinery installed on an assembly line has
a particular vulnerability to improper operation that previous
machinery did not have, leading to increased risk of the
manufacture of unsafe products. The response in this instance
may be equally narrow: to implement a different and more
frequent inspection and maintenance schedule for the newer
machinery.
Of course, the benefits of adding or improving internal controls
and other risk responses should always be weighed against
the financial and nonfinancial costs of these efforts. It may
be possible to reduce a compliance risk to an extremely
low level, but the cost of doing so in terms of slowing down
productivity may be excessive. Accordingly, cost is a practical
consideration when designing and implementing risk
responses. This potential for tension between compliance-
related controls and operational efficiency is often an
important trade-off that requires attention.
For risk responses to be executed properly, accountability
must be established. Responsibility for responses is often
shared among a variety of groups, from the business
unit directly affected by the risk to other units within the
organization, such as internal audit, human resources,
information technology, compliance, and others. For this
reason, the exact nature of the risk response should be agreed
upon by all parties that will play a role in the execution. Once
this is accomplished, a specific timeline for the execution
should be developed, with greater priority given to the risks
identified as furthest above tolerable levels.
The final aspect of risk response involves following up to
evaluate the implementation and operating effectiveness of
those responses. An excellent response plan is only as good
as its execution. Part of the response plan should include
follow-up evaluations and ongoing monitoring to determine
whether all actions in the plan have been properly carried out
and are operating as planned.
Table 4.4  Implements risk responses
Key
characteristics
• Consider potential need for modifications in each element of the C&E program when designing risk responses
• Design compliance risk responses that consider the impact on other (non-compliance) risks and risk responses
• Assign accountability for each compliance risk response (including timeline, etc.)
• Follow up to determine whether compliance risk responses have been properly implemented as designed
• Consider compliance risk responses when developing monitoring and auditing plans

Principle 14 — Develops portfolio view
It is important to recognize the interrelationship among
compliance risks, as well as the relationships between
compliance risks and other organizational risks. These
interactions can be an important consideration in both the
assessment of risk as well as the design and implementation
of risk responses. This consideration can also lead to the
identification of certain drivers of risk — factors that do not
necessarily create a new risk, but that can increase the likelihood
of one risk event as a result of some other action or event.
Here is a simple illustration: enhanced internal controls
aimed at reducing the risk of a compliance violation could
increase the risk of delays in certain operational or production
processes. This concern would be amplified if the production
team had also identified a slowness in its processes as a risk
requiring a response. The two risk responses could potentially
conflict with each other unless a portfolio view is taken in
connection with both identifying and mitigating risk.
If risks are managed in isolation without consideration of other
risks, inefficiencies — and possibly conflicts — can occur.
For this reason, viewing risks as part of an organization-wide
portfolio of risks is essential.
Another consideration in developing a portfolio view is the
extent to which compliance risks increase or decrease in
severity as they are progressively consolidated to higher levels
within the organization. A compliance risk that at first appears
to be significant at a business unit level may be rather minor
by the time it is consolidated with other risks and rolled up to
a higher level within the organization. Conversely, compliance
risks that are minor in isolation may become much greater
when consolidated with other seemingly minor risks.
Table 4.5  Develops portfolio view
Key
characteristics
• Consider risk interactions (i.e., how mitigating a compliance risk can affect other risks)
• Consider interactions of compliance risk responses with other risk responses
• Integrate compliance risk management with ERM
• Have regular meetings/communications between compliance and business units

The legal, regulatory, and ethical environments of
organizations are ones of constant change and, frequently,
increased complexity. Technological advancements have
increased the speed of communications and activity, expanding
the number of individuals an organization can affect across the
globe. Even small organizations may be operating in multiple
countries and jurisdictions, and regulations in these places are
proliferating. Stakeholder expectations regarding organizational
conduct continue to rise. Thus, for compliance risk management
to be effective, the organization must regularly review its
compliance risk management practices and capabilities and
take steps to continually improve its C&E program.
This section describes the application of the review and
revision component of the COSO ERM framework and the
following three principles associated with the management of
compliance risks:
15  Assesses substantial change
16  Reviews risk and performance
17  Pursues improvement in enterprise risk management
Principle 15 — Assesses substantial change
Changes in the organization’s internal and external
environment can have significant impacts on the
organization’s compliance risk profile, often very quickly,
which is why many compliance program standards require
periodic re-evaluation and modification. The CCO needs
to identify potential drivers of changing compliance risk.
Broadly, these potential drivers include, but are not limited to
the following:
• Changes to the organization’s strategies and objectives
• Changes to people, process, and technology
• Changes in regulatory requirements and/or societal
expectations
As Principle 6 discusses, the CCO should be involved in the
strategy-setting process to allow the C&E program to identify
and manage the change in compliance risk resulting from
significant shifts in business strategy and objectives. For
example, a technology company decides to start or acquire
a new line of business in a highly regulated environment,
such as providing cloud services for health systems’ medical
records, or an engineering firm seeks to begin contracting
with the federal government. An organizational shift to the
use of third parties for business processes may also result in
potentially significant changes to compliance risk.
Changes in the internal environment in people, processes,
and technologies can also result in changes to compliance
risk. For example, a change in senior personnel can result in
a significant shift in the level of risk tolerance as well as the
compliance culture. Increased performance pressures (cost,
sales, productivity, efficiency, etc.) can affect risk. Mergers
and acquisitions can also drive change in compliance
risk. Changes to processes and technologies may also
lead to potential changes to compliance risk. For example,
automation may result in the company being able to perform
a task faster, but it may mean that the impact of a failure will
also be magnified.
Changes in the external environment affect the organization’s
compliance risks through changes to laws, regulations,
enforcement priorities, and societal norms and values.
Assessing the impact on compliance risk has become
increasingly complex due to the proliferation of laws and
regulations across jurisdictions, often with conflicting
requirements. The C&E program needs to keep abreast of
changes to the regulatory environment through studying
information from industry and professional groups as well as
trends in enforcement and guidance provided by regulators.
There are also increasingly sophisticated regulatory change
management applications that can assist the C&E program
with identifying and tracking.

## 5. REVIEW AND REVISION

# FOR COMPLIANCE RISKS

coso.org
Enterprise Risk Management   |  Compliance Risk Management: Applying the COSO ERM Framework   |    23
Principle 16 — Reviews risk and performance
As noted in the discussion of Principle 1, the board of
directors has oversight responsibilities for the performance

## of the organization’s C&E program, and the CCO and

management are responsible for the program’s design and
implementation. For the board and management to carry out
their responsibilities, mechanisms are needed to provide
assurance that compliance risks are being managed within
tolerable levels.
The goal of the reviews of C&E program performance goes
beyond just providing the needed assurance for the board
and management to fulfill their responsibilities for managing
compliance risk to acceptable levels; the goal is also to
continually improve the C&E program. Regulators have
become more explicit in their expectations regarding the
review of C&E program performance as a critical element of
an effective compliance program. As noted earlier, one of the
seven elements of an effective compliance program under
the USSG includes the expectation “to evaluate periodically
the effectiveness of the organization’s compliance and ethics
program.” Similar expectations for assessment of the C&E
program’s performance are found in guidance from various
regulators across the globe.
The expectation is for two types of review: (1) a review
of compliance risks that are considered to be a high
priority based on their assessed likelihood and impact
of noncompliance and (2) periodic review of the overall
performance and effectiveness of the C&E program. In
addition to reviews by auditing and monitoring, there is an
expectation for the use of other mechanisms to provide
feedback regarding C&E program performance, particularly
a trusted system through which employees and others may
report or seek guidance regarding potential misconduct.
For each high-priority compliance risk, in addition to
developing an education and training strategy, the
organization should develop a monitoring and auditing
plan. Although the compliance function may take the lead
in the development of such plans, it should not be the
responsibility of compliance alone. Risk owners, internal
audit, risk management, and potentially others should be
involved in developing the plan. Role clarification for the plan
is essential to minimize duplication of effort and assurance
gaps. The plan should include a description of the planned
risk responses, who is responsible for the response, how
response effectiveness is measured, and who will be
responsible for the performance review.
One model that can help establish role clarity is the

## Three Lines Model, formerly the Three Lines of Defense,

## updated July 2020 by The Institute of Internal Auditors. This

framework distinguishes among the following three groups
(or lines) involved in effective risk management:
First line roles (management):
• Leads and directs actions (including managing risks) and
application of resources to achieve the objectives of the
organization
• Maintains a continuous dialogue with the governing body,
and reports on planned, actual, and expected outcomes
linked to the objectives of the organization, and risk
• Establishes and maintains appropriate structures and
processes for the management of operations and risk
(including internal control)
• Ensures compliance with legal, regulatory and ethical
expectations
Second line roles (management):
• Provides complementary expertise, support, monitoring,
and challenge related to the management of risk,
including the following:
- The development, implementation, and continuous
improvement of risk management practices (including
internal control) at a process, systems, and entity level

-  The achievement of risk management objectives, such
as compliance with laws, regulations, and acceptable
ethical behavior; internal control; information and
technology security; sustainability; and
quality assurance
• Provides analysis and reports on the adequacy
and effectiveness of risk management (including
internal control)
Table 5.1  Assesses substantial change
Key
characteristics
• Identify drivers of change in compliance risk — internal and external
• Consider how implementation of new strategic initiatives affects compliance risk
• Consider how changes in senior personnel affect compliance risk and/or risk tolerance
• Evaluate changes in laws and regulations
• Consider developments in enforcement, guidance from regulators, and other trends
• Assess changes in local/regional environments

Third line roles (internal audit):
• Maintains primary accountability to the governing
body and independence from the responsibilities of
management
• Communicates independent and objective assurance
and advice to management and the governing body on
the adequacy and effectiveness of governance and risk
management (including internal control) to support the
achievement of organizational objectives and to promote
and facilitate continuous improvement
• Reports impairments to independence and objectivity
to the governing body and implements safeguards as
required
Above these three lines is the organization’s governing
body. The Three Lines Model describes the governing body’s
responsibilities to include,
Delegates responsibility and provides resources
to management to achieve the objectives of the
organization while ensuring legal, regulatory, and
ethical expectations are met.
Put more simply, the board is responsible for oversight of
the compliance and ethics functions. The most senior level
of management, where the CCO sits, is responsible for
establishing structures and processes aimed at ensuring
compliance. The next level of management is responsible
for providing expertise, support and monitoring to achieve
compliance and ethics expectations.
Figure 5.1 shows how this model can be used to design an
auditing and monitoring plan for a high-risk area (conflict of
interest in an academic medical center).
In addition to the auditing and monitoring of high risks,
a review of the C&E program as a whole is necessary to
provide the needed assurance for the board and executive
management, and it is also part of Principle 17 and the
effort to continually improve the C&E program. This review
involves periodic assessment of the effectiveness of the C&E
program as a whole. There are a number of approaches that
could be taken. The review could be performed by members
of the compliance and ethics function in a self-review, by the
organization’s internal audit function, or by external service
providers. At a minimum, the review should look to see that the
C&E program incorporates all of the elements of an effective
compliance program described in the Appendix 1 (or other
applicable standard) and that they are operating effectively.
An additional resource that could be used is the Evaluation

## of Corporate Compliance Programs guidance provided by

DOJ to federal prosecutors for their use in assessing C&E
program effectiveness.2 This guidance asks the following
three fundamental questions regarding the organization’s C&E
program:

## 1. Is the organization’s C&E program well designed?

## 2. Is the program being applied earnestly and in good faith;

in other words, is the program adequately resourced and
empowered to function effectively?

## 3. Does the C&E program work in practice?

Determining the answers to these three questions requires
further inquiry into each element of an effective program, as
well as evaluating the C&E program as a whole.

Enterprise Risk Management   |  Compliance Risk Management: Applying the COSO ERM Framework   |    25
Table 5.2  Reviews risk and performance
Key
characteristics
• Monitor performance against compliance and ethics metrics and report at the management and board levels
• Update compliance risk assessments on a periodic basis
• Develop monitoring plans for high-priority risks, assign assurance responsibilities clearly across the three lines,
and set clear performance expectations
• Ensure that internal audit considers compliance risk in connection with its review of entity risk and
performance
• Periodically assess the organization’s culture of compliance
• Ensure that annual C&E program work plans reflect risk assessment (cross-referenced)
• Include appropriate audit rights clauses in third-party contracts to facilitate monitoring and auditing
• Obtain feedback from participants in compliance training, hotline reports, employee surveys, and exit
interviews
• Require that implementation of corrective action plans is an important metric monitored by management and
the board
• Perform root cause analyses for compliance risk events experienced
One issue of note in the DOJ framework is that the overall
review of the C&E program is expected to include a
measurement of the organization’s culture of compliance,
including seeking input from all levels of employees
to determine how they perceive senior and middle
management’s commitment to compliance.
Finally, in addition to monitoring and auditing, there are other
mechanisms that provide feedback on the performance
of the C&E program. A confidential reporting mechanism
through which employees and others can report suspected
misconduct involving the organization will identify specific
instances where investigation and remediation are required
and may identify opportunities to improve the program.
Employees can also use this mechanism to seek guidance and
ask questions about their work and the work environment.
When investigations of reported allegations of misconduct
conclude that there is indeed misconduct, the organization
should take appropriate steps to respond and to prevent
further similar misconduct, including making appropriate
modifications to the C&E program. Analysis of trends in
the data from the confidential reporting system (including
monitoring and auditing results and other data) should be
used to identify gaps in the design or execution of the C&E
program. Research has consistently found, however, that
in many organizations, only a small portion of misconduct
issues are reported through the confidential mechanism, so
other feedback and data points must also be considered. For
instance, many employees report misconduct to supervisors
rather than use the confidential mechanism. In the majority
of cases, these are handled by the supervisors and others
in the organization; however, the data is not necessarily
tracked or reported to compliance, so there is no feedback
on C&E program performance. To get this feedback, some
organizations have policies requiring supervisors to report
such cases to compliance so they can be tracked and
analyzed.
Other mechanisms are information from exit interviews —
where employees are asked if they have observed instances
of misconduct in the organization — periodic employee
surveys, and feedback from participants in compliance
training.
Principle 17 — Pursues improvement in enterprise
risk management
One of the key indicators of an effective C&E program is a
commitment to continuous improvement. Principles 15 and
16 explain the importance of using a variety of mechanisms
to identify substantial changes in the organization and its
environment and to identify gaps in program effectiveness.
Merely identifying issues is not enough, however. Action
must be taken to adjust and improve the C&E program.
Increasingly, regulators emphasize the importance of the
organization demonstrating its efforts to review the program
and take action to ensure that it does not become stale. For
many regulators, proactive efforts by the organization may be
rewarded with reduced fines and requirements in resolution
agreements and prosecution decisions.
The CCO should meet periodically with the board, as well
as with the organization’s internal compliance committee,
if one exists. Together, they should address the results of
performance reviews and the C&E program’s proposed
action plan to address identified gaps in C&E program
performance, as well as proactive improvements to the
program. In addition, the results of investigations where
misconduct was found should be analyzed to determine root
cause and what adjustments need to be made to the C&E
program and discussed with the respective committee.

coso.org
26    |   Enterprise Risk Management   |  Compliance Risk Management: Applying the COSO ERM Framework
Where adjustments and improvements to the C&E program
are warranted, appropriate action plans should be developed
with timelines and specific responsibilities assigned.
Progress on the action plan should be tracked, and there
should be appropriate follow-up.
Not all improvements to the C&E program are reactionary
in nature. An important aspect of continuous improvement
involves taking proactive measures. The organization should
stay current on new or improved tools, as well as innovative
approaches, that may improve program performance and
effectiveness.
Another action that can contribute to the continuous
improvement of the C&E program is benchmarking against
the practices of other organizations. Often this is done within
the same industry; however, this may be too narrow, as there
are significant differences in the maturity of compliance
programs within industries. There is much to be learned from
looking at other industries, particularly ones that, because
of their regulatory environments, have been dealing with
heightened compliance risks for some time.
Table 5.3  Pursues improvement in enterprise risk management
Key
characteristics
• Maintain awareness of current trends in compliance risk management (through training, review of regulatory
guidance, etc.)
• Ensure that compliance periodically self-assesses the C&E program’s performance
• Obtain feedback from the board on the quality and usefulness of compliance risk information shared
• Consider obtaining periodic independent evaluation of the C&E program
• Consider benchmarking the C&E program against similar organizations
• Review efficacy of the compliance risk assessment process on a periodic basis
• Ensure that internal audit plays an active role in periodically evaluating the effectiveness of the C&E program

This section describes the application of the information,
communication, and reporting component of the COSO ERM
framework and the following three principles associated with
compliance risks:
18  Leverages information and technology
19  Communicates risk information
20 Reports on risk, culture, and performance
Principle 18 — Leverages information and
technology
For a compliance function to effectively manage a C&E
program, it must have timely access to information pertaining
to each of the elements of the C&E program. For example,
to effectively carry out a monitoring and auditing function,
the compliance function must have access to all information
relevant to detecting noncompliance or breakdowns in
compliance-related internal controls.
Technology can be a vital asset in connection with several
aspects of a C&E program. For example, technology can be
utilized to deliver compliance awareness training through
a wide variety of methods and formats, with interactive
features that improve learning in comparison with other
methods, such as live classroom-based training. Technology-
assisted training is often easy to update in order to rapidly
address new issues or simply to keep training fresh.
Nowhere is technology more useful to compliance than in
the monitoring and auditing component of the C&E program.
Unlike with a sampling approach to auditing, properly
designed data analytics can analyze 100% of a population
of transactions or activities for red flags. These tests
can target (1) breakdowns in internal controls designed
to prevent noncompliance, (2) instances or patterns of
noncompliance, (3) breakdowns in internal controls designed
to detect noncompliance, or (4) other indicators or effects of
noncompliance. Data analytics look through digital records
to identify anomalies that are consistent with any of these
four targets. Further, properly designed data analytics
can be deployed in a manner that focuses on high-priority
compliance risk areas based on the risk assessment.
For example, digital markers can indicate whether certain
internal controls for compliance are functioning as designed
(e.g., is digital evidence consistent with expectations of
reviews and approvals performed by supervisors when this is
done electronically?). Digital evidence can also reveal other
anomalies that are consistent with noncompliance, such
as indications of records being altered or substituted after
a transaction has supposedly been completed. Analytics
can also be applied to unstructured data in pursuit of the
identification of compliance-related anomalies. Technology
enables organizations to scan or actively monitor electronic
communications (e.g., email, text messages, etc.) or
other text (e.g., explanations on purchase orders, journal
entries, etc.) for signs of nefarious activities. For example,
communications between a manager and their subordinates
could reveal signs of extreme pressure to meet deadlines,
increasing the risk of employees overriding key compliance
controls.
Another use of information and technology involves
performing initial assessments of information provided
through an organization’s confidential reporting mechanism.

• Utilize technology to facilitate risk assessment process (scoring, reporting, etc.)

coso.org
28    |   Enterprise Risk Management   |  Compliance Risk Management: Applying the COSO ERM Framework
Hotline calls can be a valuable source of information relating
to allegations of specific acts of noncompliance or unethical
workplace behavior. Prior to launching a full investigation
or interviewing employees, data analytics can be utilized to
assess the credibility of the allegation or help focus the scope
of the investigation.
Information and technology can also be used to provide
managers with dashboards or other reports customized to
each business unit (discussed further in Principle 20). Timely
information about compliance-related activities and results of
monitoring efforts enables managers to act quickly, minimizing
the impact of any identified problems.
Principle 19 — Communicates risk information
Of all the characteristics that benefit a C&E program,
communication is the most vital. The compliance function
should interact with virtually every business unit and function
within the organization, acting as a partner in identifying
and managing compliance and ethics risks that threaten
the organization, delivering quality training and information
regarding compliance and ethics risks, and responding to
allegations or concerns about compliance matters.
The partnership between compliance and individual business
units is essential to the effectiveness of the C&E program.
Just as the business units know their operations better than
anyone, nobody is better positioned to help the business
unit understand the ramifications of compliance and ethics
issues than the CCO and the compliance team. Accordingly,
the management of compliance risks is most effective when
there is a regular dialogue between compliance and each
business unit, resulting in a shared mission of balancing
compliance with operational efficiency. This communication is
a two-way street, not simply communication from compliance
to operations. Operations must be able to engage with
compliance in a way that ensures that solutions are both
effective and practical, and built with the real-world insights
that operations leaders bring to the table.
Effective compliance-related communication also has an
important cascading effect. Broad statements about ethics
and compliance awareness should come from the most
senior levels of management and the board of directors. From
there, communications that are more tailored to individual
departments, functions, and even specific jobs should be
developed and delivered by managers and supervisors — all
aimed at personalizing the roles that various employees have

## in the C&E program. Throughout this process, the CCO and

compliance team play an integral role, providing guidance
and even assisting in preparing certain messages, including
those addressing lessons learned from compliance failures the
organization has experienced.
Communications may take a variety of forms, from emails,
posters, and other recurring means to town halls, meetings,
and other events. Informal communications from managers
and supervisors are another effective means of articulating
employees’ roles and responsibilities in connection with
the C&E program. Collectively, these different methods of
communication should reinforce and make reference to the
more formal compliance and ethics training explained in
connection with Principle 5.
One commonly overlooked area of compliance communication
pertains to an escalation policy or protocol. Certain
allegations, issues, findings, or investigations should be
disclosed beyond the team that is charged with looking into
the matter. For example, if an allegation of improper conduct is
aimed at a lower-level employee in an organization, the team
responsible for investigating such matters likely does not need
to inform many others within the organization; however, if the
allegation was against a member of the executive team, or it
involved very serious matters, some level of disclosure of the
matter to the board of directors is necessary.
The final step in communications involves the board or
its designated committee, as introduced in Principle 1.
Much of this communication is done through the reporting
described in Principle 20. An important aspect of compliance
risk management is the discussion of risk that should take
place between the board and the CCO, including the board
challenging the CCO to ensure that all internal and external
compliance factors have been considered. Simply delivering
a report, no matter how thorough, is not sufficient and would
not demonstrate program effectiveness. It fails to demonstrate
the level of oversight that regulators expect or that is essential
to effectively manage compliance risk. In-person explanation
of issues addressed in the report, delivering meaningful
information, and discussing actionable plans for improving
the program are all steps that are important to effective
management of compliance risk.
Table 6.2  Communicates risk information
Key
characteristics
• Ensure that employees receive clear and regular communications on their roles regarding C&E
• Require periodic reporting to the board by the CCO

• Engage in effective two-way communication between operations management and compliance

coso.org
Enterprise Risk Management   |  Compliance Risk Management: Applying the COSO ERM Framework   |    29
Principle 20 — Reports on risk, culture, and
performance
Closely related to the communication of risk information is
reporting on risk, culture, and performance associated with
compliance-related risks. These stakeholders include the
board of directors, any board-level committee delegated the
responsibility of compliance risk oversight (if one exists), the
senior executive team, any internal compliance committee (if
one exists), and appropriate managers/heads of departments
or functions within the organization. Reporting to these groups
should be tailored to the unique needs and responsibilities of
each, as should the frequency of reporting.
For example, reporting to the board should focus on what
is needed for the effective oversight of the entire C&E
program — information about the risk assessment process,
identification of the most material risks and actions being
taken in response to those risks, meaningful compliance
metrics addressing both the structural and substantive
performance of the program, information about compliance-
related investigations, resource allocations and needs, etc.
Reporting to the board should also periodically address
culture as it pertains to compliance and ethics. Culture can
be a difficult area to assess; however, efforts should be made
to provide the board with some perspective and trends on
organizational culture associated with compliance and ethics.
This may be accomplished through employee surveys; data
associated with culture; and other less formal methods, such
as interviews and focus groups.
As reports are designed for each level in the organization
chart, the information included should be more granular
and customized to the needs of each layer. By the time
the reporting gets to the department head/manager level,
information should focus on what is needed to manage
compliance risk in that area, although periodic reporting on
organization-wide risk may provide helpful context.
Reports on compliance risk management should address
externally generated risks as well as those that result from
the internal risk universe (e.g., employee acts). Third-party
risk management is an important element of a C&E program.
Accordingly, reports should be prepared and distributed
to appropriate stakeholders on the status of third-party
suppliers, sales agents, and others who could create risk for
the organization. These reports should focus on the results of
third-party due diligence efforts in the selection or continued
use of vendors and other third parties, site visits, auditing and
monitoring procedures, training provided to third parties, and
any other matter associated with managing this area of risk.
One final aspect of reporting that is critical to C&E program
effectiveness is documentation. Typically, documentation
involving investigations is maintained and reviewed only by
the compliance, legal, and/or investigations team. It is crucial
to properly handle, preserve, and maintain these materials
and records in the event of legal action or government
inquiry. Each compliance-related investigation should be
well documented, include a timeline of events and key steps/
actions taken along the way, and summarize any remedial
steps. Whether a formal case management software tool is
used or something simpler is utilized, maintaining this record
is an important part of a C&E program. From these records,
useful reports can be generated that provide insight into the
needs and effectiveness of the investigations element of
compliance risk management.
Table 6.3  Reports on risk, culture, and performance
Key
characteristics
• Provide periodic reports on compliance and ethics risk assessments and related remediation efforts tailored to
key stakeholder needs
• Develop and report on meaningful operational and substantive metrics associated with the effectiveness of
the C&E program

• Use a case management and reporting system for investigations and outcomes
• Establish and follow a policy that clearly articulates the nature of reporting on all significant remediation
efforts

Introduction
The seven elements of an effective compliance and ethics
program are described in the U.S. Federal Sentencing
Guidelines (USSG), ¶8B2.1, subsection (b) as follows:
(1)  The organization shall establish standards and procedures
to prevent and detect criminal conduct.
(2) (A) The organization’s governing authority shall be
knowledgeable about the content and operation of
the compliance and ethics program and shall exercise
reasonable oversight with respect to the
implementation and effectiveness of the compliance
and ethics program.
(B)  High-level personnel of the organization shall ensure
that the organization has an effective compliance and
ethics program, as described in this guideline. Specific
individual(s) within high-level personnel shall be
assigned overall responsibility for the compliance
and ethics program.
(C)  Specific individual(s) within the organization shall
be delegated day-to-day operational responsibility
for the compliance and ethics program. Individual(s)
with operational responsibility shall report periodically
to high-level personnel and, as appropriate, to the
governing authority, or an appropriate subgroup of the
governing authority, on the effectiveness of the
compliance and ethics program. To carry out such
operational responsibility, such individual(s) shall be
given adequate resources, appropriate authority, and
direct access to the governing authority or an a
ppropriate subgroup of the governing authority.
(3)  The organization shall use reasonable efforts not to include
within the substantial authority personnel of the organization
any individual whom the organization knew, or should have
known through the exercise of due diligence, has engaged
in illegal activities or other conduct inconsistent with an
effective compliance and ethics program.
(4)  (A) The organization shall take reasonable steps to
communicate periodically and in a practical manner
its standards and procedures, and other aspects of
the compliance and ethics program, to the individuals
referred to in subparagraph (B) by conducting effective
training programs and otherwise disseminating
information appropriate to such individuals’ respective
roles and responsibilities.
(B) The individuals referred to in subparagraph (A)
are the members of the governing authority,
high- level personnel, substantial authority personnel,
the organization’s employees, and, as appropriate, the
organization’s agents.
(5)  The organization shall take reasonable steps—
(A)  to ensure that the organization’s compliance and ethics
program is followed, including monitoring and auditing
to detect criminal conduct;
(B)  to evaluate periodically the effectiveness of the
organization’s compliance and ethics program; and
(C)  to have and publicize a system, which may include
mechanisms that allow for anonymity or confidentiality,
whereby the organization’s employees and agents
may report or seek guidance regarding potential or
actual criminal conduct without fear of retaliation.
(6)  The organization’s compliance and ethics program shall
be promoted and enforced consistently throughout the
organization through (A) appropriate incentives to perform
in accordance with the compliance and ethics program;
and (B) appropriate disciplinary measures for engaging in
criminal conduct and for failing to take reasonable steps to
prevent or detect criminal conduct.
(7)  After criminal conduct has been detected, the organization
shall take reasonable steps to respond appropriately to
the criminal conduct and to prevent further similar criminal
conduct, including making any necessary modifications to
the organization’s compliance and ethics program.

## APPENDIX 1.

## Elements of an Effective Compliance and Ethics Program

coso.org
32    |   Enterprise Risk Management   |  Compliance Risk Management: Applying the COSO ERM Framework
¶8B2.1, subsection (c) follows by stating:
In implementing subsection (b), the organization shall
periodically assess the risk of criminal conduct and shall
take appropriate steps to design, implement, or modify each
requirement set forth in subsection (b) to reduce the risk of
criminal conduct identified through this process.
This final provision requiring periodic compliance risk
assessments and continuous improvement of the C&E
program, which was added in 2004, is often referred to as the
eighth element of a C&E program.
All seven elements of a C&E program, along with periodic
risk assessments and ongoing program improvement, must
be in place and functioning well in order for the program to
be considered effective. It should be noted that the USSG,
which set forth the seven elements, are guidelines for
federal judges, but they may be much more than “guidelines”
for organizations. The word “shall” appears 17 times in
connection with the elements, and many believe the guidelines
represent the minimum standards for building an effective C&E
program, at least for U.S. organizations and others operating in
the U.S., as well as U.S.-based multinational companies.
This appendix is devoted to an overview of each of these
elements, forming the basis for understanding the guidance
on its application to ERM found in earlier sections of this
publication.
Standards and procedures
Standards of conduct demonstrate an organization’s
commitment to an ethical workplace and a culture of
compliance with laws and regulations. This begins with a code
of business conduct and ethics. The code should be designed
to apply to all employees, management, and the board. The
code is supported by many policies and procedures. A code
should also apply to certain third parties, such as vendors
and suppliers, although this code is often different and more
abbreviated than the code that applies to employees.
Two types of policies and procedures are essential to a C&E
program: structural and substantive. Structural policies create
the framework for how the program operates. Substantive
policies address the organization’s positions on the key laws,
regulations, and standards that apply to its business activities.
Examples of structural policies and procedures are those that
define the roles and responsibilities of the compliance officer,
compliance committee, and the board; methods for reporting
suspected wrongdoing; processes used for auditing and
monitoring; investigative responsibilities and procedures; and
many others.
Substantive policies focus on preventing and detecting
specific compliance violations (e.g., bribery, false claims,
antitrust, environmental, record retention) by communicating
the organization’s expectations for employee behavior in
connection with individual risk areas.
Governance, oversight, and authority
The compliance and ethics function should be subject to
effective oversight at the board, management, and compliance
officer level.
The board has a clear responsibility to ensure that an effective
C&E program is in place and to provide adequate oversight of
the program by being knowledgeable about the content and
operation of the program. The board must also ensure that the
CCO is positioned at a senior level within the organization and
has adequate resources and authority to effectively manage
the program.
In some instances, compliance oversight at the board level
is delegated to a committee, such an audit or compliance
committee. In other cases, compliance oversight is handled
by the board as a whole. Either way, the CCO should have
a reporting relationship with the board or a committee of
the board, even if there is also a reporting line to another
executive position, such as to the CEO.
In this respect, the compliance function is similar to an internal
audit function, where independence and autonomy are
important. From a day-to-day operational standpoint, the top
compliance professional may report to another member of the
senior management team, but there should always be a direct
reporting line to the board as well so that the compliance
officer can have candid discussions without interference from
other members of management.
Although the board provides oversight, management is
responsible for executing the program — ensuring that
employees complete training, report concerns, fix problems, or
perform work activities consistent with program requirements.
The USSG recognized that it is ultimately management that is
responsible for the ensuring the program is effective.
The CCO has day-to-day responsibility for operating the
C&E program and must have the necessary resources and
access to information to operate the program. Sufficiency of
resources was added to the list of factors the DOJ considers
when evaluating compliance programs in the June 2020

## revision to its Evaluation of Corporate Compliance

Programs guidance.
There may also be an internal compliance committee, with
representatives from major functional areas and/or operating
divisions. Although the CCO may be the most visible leader of
a C&E program, an internal compliance committee can be a
very effective method of program management, ensuring that

coso.org
Enterprise Risk Management   |  Compliance Risk Management: Applying the COSO ERM Framework   |    33
each operating division approaches compliance similarly. An
additional benefit of such a compliance committee is the value
created by collaboration and input across functional areas to
support the overarching objectives of the C&E program.
The final critical element of compliance oversight involves
making sure there is a clear and written understanding of
the roles and responsibilities of each of these functions or
committees. This may be documented in the form of a charter
or policy.
Due diligence in delegation of authority
Organizations should perform background checks before
hiring new employees and additional periodic checks when
permitted or required by law. In addition, the organization
should consider the person’s past support of (or failure to
support or execute) the organization’s C&E program when
promoting employees to positions of greater authority. The
level and type of background check should correspond to the
position of each employee, based on the role that person has,
or will have, in relation to compliance risks.
The USSG refer to this expectation in connection with
“substantial authority personnel,” a term defined in the
application notes as “individuals who within the scope of
their authority exercise a substantial measure of discretion
in acting on behalf of an organization,” noting that these
individuals may or may not be considered management. The
clear inference is that the scope of diligence should grow
as the level of responsibility grows. Compliance may wish to
work with human resources and other functions to make these
determinations.
Though not explicitly stated in the USSG, regulators have
grown to expect that organizations perform appropriate
levels of due diligence on third parties that create or involve
compliance risk for the organization. For example, if a
company utilizes a third party located in another country to
represent the organization, or to sell to customers in that
country, an appropriately scaled background check — based
on the assessed level of compliance risk involved — would
be expected.
Communication and training
Communication and training, when done effectively, contribute
to the prevention and detection of compliance issues. Every
employee and member of the board of directors should receive
training on general topics that are important to the program,
and more focused training on specific compliance matters
should be provided to personnel involved in activities relevant
to each compliance risk.
General training, done on at least an annual basis, for all
employees and the board of directors is a hallmark of a robust
and effective program. General training covers the code of
conduct, maintaining a culture of compliance and ethics,
how to seek guidance and report suspected problems, the
organization’s nonretaliation policy, what the organization does
when suspected compliance issues are reported, and any
other relevant aspect of the program that affects everyone.
Focused training dives deeper into specific compliance
risk areas, critical internal controls, and other procedures
associated with specific risks. Consequently, only those
employees who play key roles involving those risk areas
are typically required to participate in this type of training.
An example of focused training is a program aimed at sales
personnel of an international company on compliance with

## the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. It is not necessary for

every employee to understand what constitutes a violation
of the act, but it is critical for individuals involved in
international sales (and relevant support and finance teams)
to have a sound understanding of this risk as well as the
controls and procedures the organization has implemented
to prevent misconduct.
To be effective, training must be more than simple delivery
of educational content. In its June 2020 guidance, DOJ
emphasized the importance of (1) allowing employees to ask
questions during training and (2) evaluating whether training
affected employee behavior.
Although much of the training that involves compliance topics
is in the form of either traditional classroom style presentations
or online, web-based programs, training may also involve other
forms of education and communication. For instance, an email
message or a company newsletter may be used to inform the
workforce or reinforce traditional training on new or changed
compliance requirements. Communications may also address
lessons learned from compliance failures the organization has
experienced.
Organizations can sometimes be held accountable for
compliance failures of third parties. Accordingly, training
should be considered for each third party based on an
assessment of the associated type and level of
compliance risk.
Finally, other forms of general communications also help
to create and maintain a culture of compliance and ethics.
Examples include supportive messages from the CEO,
informative articles in company newsletters, and many others.
Monitoring, auditing, and reporting systems
Monitoring, in the broad sense, refers to the assessment of
whether processes are operating as intended in pursuit of
the system’s improvement. Sometimes the term “monitoring”
is used more narrowly to contrast with “auditing,” where
auditing refers to an assessment by individuals independent of
the system. Both auditing and monitoring draw on the same set

coso.org
34    |   Enterprise Risk Management   |  Compliance Risk Management: Applying the COSO ERM Framework
of methods and techniques, with a goal of obtaining assurance
on the quality of the system’s performance over time and
contributing to its continuous improvement (see figure A.1).
Figure A.1  Auditing, monitoring and reporting

Other
Performance

Monitoring
(nonindependent)
Accordingly, auditing is performed by individuals independent
of the function being reviewed. Auditing may be performed
by an internal audit department, other third parties, or by
individuals within the compliance function if structured so as
to maintain their independence. Monitoring is often performed
by a quality assurance function or managers, supervisors, and
other employees within the function being reviewed.
A monitoring and auditing plan is an important driver of
compliance program effectiveness, and it should be designed
and updated based on periodic risk assessments. Monitoring
and auditing activities should be aimed at both (1) detecting
noncompliance (or signs of noncompliance) and (2) identifying
breakdowns in internal controls over compliance, such
as areas in which a preventive or detective control is not
functioning as designed. A wide variety of techniques may be
used in monitoring and auditing. Examples include observation
and site visits, surveys, questionnaires and checklists,
interviews, reviewing transactions and documentation, data
analytics, and reviewing digital evidence. The audit function
may also provide assurance to the board regarding the overall
effectiveness of a C&E program.
Another important mechanism of an effective C&E program
involves maintaining a trusted system for seeking guidance
and reporting suspected wrongdoing by employees (and
others). Employees should have multiple avenues for seeking
guidance regarding compliance and ethics issues and for
reporting what they perceive as potential violations of laws,
regulations, or the organization’s policies and procedures.
Although employees may be encouraged to report matters
to their supervisors, organizations must recognize that
there may be situations in which that is not desirable or
practical. Accordingly, making employees aware of other
options for reporting is important. Other options may involve
telephone- or email-based systems (internal or operated by
independent third parties) or direct reporting to others within
the organization, such as human resources, compliance,
internal audit, an investigations unit, certain members of
senior management, or even the board or audit/compliance
committee.
Characteristics of an effective reporting system include user
options that allow for the following:

## 1. Anonymous reporting — The reporter’s identity is not

known (where allowed by law ), often achieved through a
hotline or similar mechanism

## 2. Confidential reporting — The reporter’s identity is known

only to a select few, and those few are expected to take
reasonable steps to maintain that confidentiality while
pursuing the matter

## 3. Open reporting — The reporter is willing or desires to

have their identity disclosed without limitations
These and any other methods of reporting should be
developed with consideration for federal, state, and local laws
in the countries and regions in which the reporting system
operates.
For any reporting to be effective, it must be trusted. Trust is
driven by many factors, but the most important two are (1) a
belief that the organization will take allegations and concerns
seriously and perform a proper assessment in response and (2)
that reporters can expect to be free from retaliation after they
have reported their observations and concerns in good faith.
Finally, DOJ encourages publicizing reporting systems to third
parties, in addition to employees. Vendors, suppliers, and other
third parties are often in a unique position to observe signs of
possible violations that might not immediately be observable
by employees.
All matters reported should be reviewed and assessed
in a timely manner. The assessment of a report should
consider whether further investigation is necessary based
on the information provided by the reporter, the nature and
seriousness of the possible violation, and any other information
known that is relevant to the report.
Even in the most trusted of systems, some employees may not
feel comfortable reporting wrongdoing until they are leaving
an organization. As a result, exit interviews of departing
employees should provide one final opportunity for the
employee to report suspected wrongdoing and to provide
feedback in other areas related to the C&E program.
Investigations may result from information obtained via the
reporting system, but may also stem from an organization’s

coso.org
Enterprise Risk Management   |  Compliance Risk Management: Applying the COSO ERM Framework   |    35
auditing and monitoring activities or even outside parties (e.g.,
customers, competitors, suppliers). Regardless of what event
triggered the concern, an investigation should be prompt,
thorough, and independent of the affected function or person,
and it should be performed in accordance with written policies
and procedures. Case files or other documentation should
be maintained and protected to ensure the integrity of each
investigation. Investigations are described further in the
section on responding to wrongdoing.
It is important to note that the investigation and resolution
of allegations are not the only goals of these reporting
mechanisms. An equally important goal is the feedback
provided on the C&E program’s performance so that the
program can be improved. This requires tracking and analysis
of the trends in issues being reported and the areas where
guidance is being sought so that appropriate steps can be
taken to increase the C&E program’s effectiveness.
Incentives and enforcement
Noncompliance can be entirely unintentional — often the
result of ineffective controls, ineffective training or new
employee orientation, misunderstanding of procedures,
a deteriorating culture, or simply carelessness. A natural
deterioration in processes and internal controls occurs over
time, unless the processes or internal controls are consistently
enforced. Noncompliance can also be intentional —  carried
out by employees who know they are violating organization
policies and who may understand that they are violating laws
and regulations in the process.
The USSG require the use of incentives and similar tools to
promote consistent participation in and/or execution of the
C&E program. Just as boards and executives use financial
and recognition incentives to promote sales, safety outcomes,
customer or employee satisfaction, and other strategic
goals, the USSG state that incentives should be a component
of an organization’s compliance efforts. Incentives can be
particularly effective in motivating leaders to embrace and
execute on the compliance program but can also be used
effectively at all levels in the organization. Incentives can
be financial or nonfinancial in nature and can be effectively
integrated with an organization’s performance management
system.
In its explanation of enforcement, the USSG recommend
appropriate consequences for ignoring compliance obligations
or violations of law or policy. Such discipline should consider
whether acts of noncompliance, or the failure to act, was
intentional or unintentional, as well as the severity of the
noncompliance. The organization should provide for a range
of potential disciplinary actions, from verbal and written
warnings up to termination of employment.
Organizational justice is critical to the success of a C&E
program. Accordingly, enforcement and discipline must be
consistent across all levels of the organization, perhaps most
importantly at the highest levels. If the noncompliance of a
highly successful salesperson, an executive, or an influential
employee is tolerated while another employee is disciplined
for the same violation, the C&E program’s credibility will be
undermined, and the organization’s culture can be harmed.
As with all elements of a C&E program, discipline should
always consider the local/regional legal environment, as well
as contractual or labor union provisions.
In connection with incentives and enforcement involving
vendors, suppliers, and other third parties that may create
liability, the organization should ensure that there are
appropriately tailored contract provisions imposing relevant
compliance obligations and addressing the consequences
of noncompliance, including penalty provisions and contract
termination clauses.
Response to wrongdoing
No C&E program guarantees a lifetime of compliance for an
organization. If an organization is around long enough or is
large enough, noncompliance is inevitable regardless of how
effective the program is.
What an organization does in response to noncompliance is
an important factor that distinguishes effective programs from
ineffective programs. There are two key aspects of responding
to wrongdoing: investigating and remediating.
A compliance investigation must be prompt and thorough,
fair to all parties, and conducted by individuals who are
independent from the subjects and not otherwise conflicted.
Other key considerations in conducting a compliance
investigation include the following:

## 1. Notifications — Who should be informed about the

investigation (e.g., leaders, legal, outside parties)?

## 2. Expertise — Does the organization have all the expertise

needed to conduct the investigation, or should outside
assistance be brought in?

## 3. Involvement of compliance — Regardless of whether the

compliance officer is conducting the investigation, the
compliance officer should be informed and involved along
the way.

## 4. Documentation — Collect, protect, and preserve

evidence and other documentation gathered as part of an
investigation.

## 5. Oversight and management — The larger the

investigation, the more important it is to establish an
appropriate chain of command (including the involvement
of legal counsel where appropriate), for all parties
involved to have their work overseen and reviewed, and
for the scope of the investigation to be well managed.

## 6. Scope — Understand what the scope of an investigation

is from the outset and gear the investigation plan
accordingly.
There are many steps to an investigation (e.g., gathering
documents, identifying electronic records, conducting
interviews of personnel). And in the end, there may or may
not be any need or desire for a written report. But the case
file should always be closed out properly.
If the investigation uncovers compliance failures, a root
cause analysis should be performed to fully understand
where any breakdowns or omissions in internal controls
occurred, or whether weaknesses in the design of internal
controls were identified. Once this is done, the organization
must turn its attention to remediating the underlying
problems. In cases in which existing policies and procedures
were well designed, but the execution of those controls
failed, remediation may require nothing more than training
(or retraining) certain groups of employees on those controls
and the reinstatement or introduction of the appropriate
monitoring processes.
In other cases, remediation involves significantly more effort.
Modifying policies and procedures, improving preventive
controls, changing business processes or incentives, and
any other remediation efforts should all be aimed at making
sure a particular act of noncompliance does not happen
again. In cases where prevention is costly or impractical,
remediation might involve adding or modifying detective
controls so that if noncompliance occurs in the future, it
will be detected and corrected sooner, resulting in reduced
losses or penalties. Regardless of the nature of planned
actions, accountability for fully implementing remediation
plans should be established and monitored.
Risk assessment and program improvement
Regulators consistently emphasize the importance of taking
a risk-based approach to training, monitoring and auditing,
and the other elements of a C&E program. As such, a
sound risk assessment process is critical. Approaches and
considerations for assessing the risk of compliance and
ethics events are generally very similar to assessing other
types of risks. For example, a typical approach would include
the following steps:

## 1. Identify compliance risks that are inherent to the

organization’s activities

## 2. Map compliance risks to existing internal controls

## 3. Assess the effectiveness of internal controls

## 4. Assess the likelihood and impact of each compliance risk

## 5. Prioritize (via scoring, heat maps, or other methods)

compliance risks based on the assessment

## 6. Design risk responses (e.g., improvements to internal

controls, training) to reduce risk to an acceptable level

## 7. Assign responsibility and monitor implementation of risk

responses
Although these are the core elements of a typical risk
assessment, many additional factors can be considered
to further enhance the quality of a risk assessment. Risk
assessments should be updated periodically, either on a
fixed time interval or when relevant new information comes
to light indicating a change may have occurred that affects
a risk.
Another 2004 addition to the USSG involves an expectation that
efforts are made to continuously improve the C&E program.
Periodic risk assessment is one method of identifying needed
improvements to the program. But there are many other ways
of identifying improvements: a thorough root cause analysis
at the conclusion of an investigation, feedback mechanisms,
auditing and monitoring, and others. Benchmarking against
other organizations is also an effective method of assessing
program effectiveness. Assessing program effectiveness can
be performed internally or by third parties (e.g., consulting
firms). Additionally, looking outside the organization —
attending conferences, reading publications, and monitoring
government guidance — is an excellent way to identify
emerging practices that can be adopted to improve a program.

As described in section 1, global recognition of C&E
programs has grown considerably in recent years. In this
appendix, a few additional examples are provided.
France
Guidance on anticorruption compliance programs from the

## French Anticorruption Agency (AFA) in conjunction with

the 2016 French Sapin II Law was issued in 2017 and then
updated in December 2019. The guidance notes that the
compliance officer’s mission may go beyond anticorruption to
include other laws, such as anti-money laundering, antitrust,
data privacy and others deemed appropriate for the scope
of the program. The following eight expected areas of a
program are described in the AFA’s guidance:

## 1. Commitment by top management, including policies

and procedures, governance over the program that
extends to the highest level of the organization, and
communication about the program with employees and
external partners

## 2. A code of conduct

## 3. An internal whistleblowing system

## 4. Risk mapping, including risk assessment, prioritization

and management

## 5. Third-party due diligence

## 6. Accounting controls

## 7. Risk training for managers and other employees exposed

to risks

## 8. Internal monitoring and assessment

Brazil
Brazil’s Clean Companies Act, which took effect in 2014,
provides for penalties for the commission of certain acts,
including bribery, money-laundering, and fraud in public
bidding for contracts, and other offenses. The law required
the government to issue a regulation on the act, which it did
in the form of a 2015 decree (8.420/15). The decree states that
a program will be evaluated for its existence and application,
according to the following parameters:

## 1. Commitment by the top management of the legal entity,

including the councils, evidenced by the visible and
unequivocal support for the program

## 2. Standards of conduct, code of ethics, policies,

and procedures applicable to all employees and
administrators, regardless of their position or function

## 3. Standards of conduct, code of ethics and policies

extended, when necessary, to third parties, such as
suppliers, service providers, intermediary agents, and
associates

## 4. Periodic training on the program

## 5. Periodic risk analysis to make necessary adaptations

to the program

## 6. Accounting records that fully and accurately reflect

the transactions of the entity

## 7. Internal controls that ensure the prompt elaboration and

reliability of reports and financial statements of the entity

## 8. Specific procedures to prevent fraud and illicit

activities in the context of bidding processes, in
the execution of administrative contracts or in any
interaction with the public sector, even if intermediated
by third parties, such as payment of taxes, subjection
to inspections, or obtaining authorizations, licenses,
permits, and certificates

## 9. Independence, structure, and authority of the internal

body responsible for implementing the program and
monitoring compliance with it

## 10. Channels of whistleblowing, open and widely

disseminated to employees and third parties, and
mechanisms designed to protect whistleblowers

## 11. Disciplinary measures in case of violation of the

program

## 12. Procedures that ensure the prompt interruption of

detected irregularities or infractions and the timely
remediation of the damages generated

## 13. Appropriate procedures for contracting and, as the

case may be, supervision of third parties, such as
suppliers, service providers, intermediary agents, and
associates

## 14. Verification, during mergers, acquisitions, and

corporate restructuring processes, of the commission
of irregularities or illicit acts or of the existence of
vulnerabilities in the entities involved

## 15. Continuous monitoring of the program aiming at

improving it in preventing, detecting, and combating
the occurrence of acts prohibited under the law

## 16. Transparency of the entity regarding donations to

candidates and political parties
The decree states that in evaluating the compliance program,
consideration will be given to the unique features of the
organization, including the number of employees, number
of locations, countries in which it operates, it industry, its
complexity, and its use of third parties.
This provision is consistent with U.S. guidance stating that
there is no “one size fits all” approach to C&E programs.
Every program should be tailored to fit the unique needs of
the organization.

## Costa Rica

Costa Rica is another Latin American country (along with
Argentina, Peru, and Chile in 2018) to recently enact a law
addressing compliance programs. The scope of the 2019
Costa Rican law is domestic and international bribery and
corruption, as well as falsifying books and records to conceal
such corruption. Significant penalties can be reduced if a
company has a compliance program in place. Expectations
of the C&E program as described in the law include the
following:

## 1. Conduct a risk assessment for the business activity in

## Costa Rica

## 2. Implement a code of conduct and adopt specific rules

and processes that prevent the commission of crimes

## 3. Establish specific policies and procedures to prevent

crimes relating to public bidding contracts, obtaining
licenses, or any other activity related to the public
administration

## 4. Determine the scope of these policies for third parties

## 5. Establish adequate financial controls and financial

records aimed at the prevention of wrongdoing

## 6. Periodic anti-corruption training, including training for

third parties

## 7. Perform periodic risk assessments and modify the

program accordingly

## 8. Establish a disciplinary model for noncompliance

## 9. Appoint a compliance officer and provide adequate

capacity and resources for the program

## 10. Conduct an external accounting audit

## New Zealand

## The Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing

## of Terrorism Act took effect in July 2013. One of the

requirements of the act is the appointment of a compliance
officer and development of a reporting and compliance
program.
The key elements of a compliance program must include the
following:

## 1. A comprehensive risk assessment

## 2. Vetting and training obligations for managers

## 3. Reporting procedures

## 4. Recordkeeping

## 5. Due diligence

## 6. Other processes for minimizing the risk of abuses

Singapore

## Singapore’s Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau in

2017 published “PACT – A Practical Anti-Corruption Guide

## for Businesses in Singapore” to assist organization’s in

## complying with The Prevention of Corruption Act. The guide

describes the following four steps (thus the acronym, PACT)
that companies can take to prevent corruption:

## 1. Pledge — Tone from the top, anti-corruption policies,

and a code of conduct

## 2. Assess — Conduct periodic risk assessments

## 3. Control and communicate — Internal controls, audit

checks, training and communication, and a robust
reporting system

## 4. Track — Evaluate and improve the anti-corruption

system
Spain

## Amendments to Spain’s Criminal Code that took effect on July

1, 2015, provide for the regulation of corporate compliance
programs. The amended code provides companies with an
exemption from criminal liability for crimes committed by
their officers or employees if the company has adopted a
compliance program that includes the following six elements:

## 1. Risk assessment

## 2. Standards and controls to mitigate any criminal risks

detected

## 3. Financial controls to prevent the crimes

## 4. Obligation to report to the compliance body

any violations of the standards and controls (a
whistleblowing channel)

## 5. Disciplinary system to sanction violations of the

compliance program by officers and employees

## 6. Periodic review of the compliance program, making

the necessary adjustments when serious violations
occur or when the company undergoes organizational,
structural, or economic changes.
Summary
The summary in this appendix is far from complete and
is provided only to illustrate some of the similarities and
differences among a handful of the many nations that have
promulgated some form of requirement or guidance relating
to compliance and ethics programs. Organizations should
always consult the laws and regulations of each jurisdiction
in which they operate for further guidance.
