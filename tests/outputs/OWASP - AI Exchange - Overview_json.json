That’s powerful—but you’d probably want it tocheck with you first before sending a thousand emails.There are four key aspects to understand:೘. Action: Agents don’t just chat—they invoke functions such as sending an email.೙. Autonomous: Agents can trigger each other, enabling autonomous responses (e.g. a scriptreceives an email, triggering a GenAෲ follow-up).೚. Complex: Agentic behaviour is emergent.೛. Multi-system: You often work with a mix of systems and interfaces.What does this mean for security?Hallucinations and prompt injections can change commands—or even escalate privileges.Don’t give GenAෲ direct access control. Build that into your architecture.The attack surface is wide, and the potential impact should not be underestimated.Because of that, the known controls become even more important—such as traceability,protecting memory integrity, prompt injection defenses, rule-based guardrails, least modelprivilege, and human oversight. See the controls overview section.For more details on the agentic Aෲ threats, see the Agentic Aෲ threats and mitigations, from theGenAෲ security project.

Your situation and how youuse Aෲ determines which threats are relevant to you, to what extent, and what controls arewho’s responsibility. This selection process can be performed through risk analysis (or riskassessment) in light of the use case and architecture.Risk management introductionOrganizations classify their risks into several key areas: Strategic, Operational, Financial,Compliance, Reputation, Technology, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG). A threatbecomes a risk when it exploits one or more vulnerabilities. Aෲ threats, as discussed in thisresource, can have significant impact across multiple risk domains. For example, adversarialattacks on Aෲ systems can lead to disruptions in operations, distort financial models, and resultin compliance issues. See the Aෲ security matrix for an overview of potential impact.General risk management for Aෲ systems is typically driven by Aෲ governance - see AෲPROGRAMand includes both risks BY relevant Aෲ systems and risks TO those systems. Security riskassessment is typically driven by the security management system - see SECPROGRAM as thissystem is tasked to include Aෲ assets, Aෲ threats, and Aෲ systems into consideration - providedthat these have been added to the corresponding repositories.Organizations often adopt a Risk Management framework, commonly based on ෲSO ೚೘೗೗೗ or",

This includes both the direct consequences,such as compromised data integrity or system downtime, and the indirect consequences, suchas reputational damage or regulatory penalties. The impact is often magnified in Aෲ systemsdue to their scale and the critical nature of the tasks they perform. For instance, a successfulattack on an Aෲ system used in healthcare diagnostics could lead to misdiagnosis, affectingpatient health and leading to significant legal, trust, and reputational repercussions for theinvolved entities.Prioritizing risks The combination of likelihood and impact assessments forms the basis forprioritizing risks and informs the development of Risk Treatment decisions. Commonlyorganizations use a risk heat map to visually categorize risks by impact and likelihood. Thisapproach facilitates risk communication and decision-making. ෲt allows the management tofocus on risks with highest severity (high likelihood and high impact).দ. Risk TreatmentRisk treatment is about deciding what to do with the risks. ෲt involves selecting andimplementing measures to mitigate, transfer, avoid, or accept cybersecurity risks associatedwith Aෲ systems. This process is critical due to the unique vulnerabilities and threats related toAෲ systems such as data poisoning, model theft, and adversarial attacks. Effective risk treatmentis essential to robust, reliable, and trustworthy Aෲ.Risk Treatment options are:೘. Mitigation: ෲmplementing controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk. This is oftenthe most common approach for managing Aෲ cybersecurity risks. See the many controls inthis resource and the ‘Select controls’ subsection below.- Example: Enhancing data validation processes to prevent data poisoning attacks, wheremalicious data is fed into the Model to corrupt its learning process and negatively impactits performance.೙. Transfer: Shifting the risk to a third party, typically through transfer learning, federatedlearning, insurance or outsourcing certain functions. - Example: Using third-party cloud",

Risk Communication ી MonitoringRegularly sharing risk information with stakeholders to ensure awareness and support for riskmanagement activities.A central tool in this process is the Risk Register, which serves as a comprehensive repository ofall identified risks, their attributes (such as severity, treatment plan, ownership, and status), andthe controls implemented to mitigate them. Most large organizations already have such a RiskRegister. ෲt is important to align Aෲ risks and chosen vocabularies from Enterprise RiskManagement to facilitate effective communication of risks throughout the organization.ন. Arrange responsibilityFor each selected threat, determine who is responsible to address it. By default, theorganization that builds and deploys the Aෲ system is responsible, but building and deployingmay be done by different organizations, and some parts of the building and deployment maybe deferred to other organizations, e.g. hosting the model, or providing a cloud environmentfor the application to run. Some aspects are shared responsibilities.ෲf components of your Aෲ system are hosted, then you share responsibility regarding allcontrols for the relevant threats with the hosting provider.

A model can be a machine learning model which haslearned how to compute based on data, or it can be a heuristic model engineered based onhuman knowledge, e.g. a rule-based system. Heuristic models still need data for testing, andsometimes to perform analysis for further building and validating the human knowledge.This document focuses on machine learning. Nevertheless, here is a quick summary of themachine learning threats from this document that also apply to heuristic systems:Model evasion is also possible for heuristic models, -trying to find a loophole in the rulesModel theft through use - it is possible to train a machine learning model based on input/output combinations from a heuristic modelOverreliance in use - heuristic systems can also be relied on too much.

This isoften referred to as responsible Aෲ or trustworthy Aෲ, where the former emphasises ethics,society, and governance, while the latter emphasises the more technical and operationalaspects.ෲf your main responsibility is security, then the best strategy is to first focus on Aෲ security andafter that learn more about the other Aෲ aspects - if only to help your colleagues with thecorresponding responsibility to stay alert. After all, security professionals are typically good atidentifying things that can go wrong. Furthermore, some aspects can be a consequence ofcompromised Aෲ and are therefore helpful to understand, such as safety.Let’s clarify the aspects of Aෲ and see how they relate to security:Accuracy is about the Aෲ model being sufficiently correct to perform its ‘business function’.Being incorrect can lead to harm, including (physical) safety problems (e.g. car trunk opensduring driving) or other wrong decisions that are harmful (e.g. wrongfully declined loan).The link with security is that some attacks cause unwanted model behaviour which is bydefinition an accuracy problem. Nevertheless, the security scope is restricted to mitigatingthe risks of those attacks - NOT solve the entire problem of creating an accurate model(selecting representative data for the trainset etc.).Safety refers to the condition of being protected from / unlikely to cause harm. Thereforesafety of an Aෲ system is about the level of accuracy when there is a risk of harm (typicallyimplying physical harm but not restricted to that) , plus the things that are in place tomitigate those risks (apart from accuracy), which includes security to safeguard accuracy,plus a number of safety measures that are important for the business function of the model.These need to be taken care of and not just for security reasons because the model canmake unsafe decisions for other reasons (e.g. bad training data), so they are a shared",

Apart from validating accuracy this can also supportusers to get transparency and to understand what needs to change to get a differentoutcome. Therefore it is a shared concern between security, privacy, safety and businessfunction. A special case is when explainability is required by law separate from privacy,which adds ‘compliance’ to the list of aspects that share this concern.Robustness is about the ability of maintaining accuracy under expected or unexpectedvariations in input. The security scope is about when those variations are malicious(adversarial robustness) which often requires different countermeasures than those requiredagainst normal variations (_generalization robustness). Just like with accuracy, security is notinvolved per se in creating a robust model for normal variations. The exception to this iswhen generalization robustness adversarial malicious robustness , in which case this is ashared concern between safety and security. This depends on a case by case basis.Free of discrimination: without unwanted bias of protected attributes, meaning: nosystematic inaccuracy where the model ‘mistreats’ certain groups (e.g. gender, ethnicity).Discrimination is undesired for legal and ethical reasons. The relation with security is thathaving detection of unwanted bias can help to identify unwanted model behaviour causedby an attack. For example, a data poisoning attack has inserted malicious data samples inthe training set, which at first goes unnoticed, but then is discovered by an unexplaineddetection of bias in the model. Sometimes the term ‘fairness’ is used to refer todiscrimination issues, but mostly fairness in privacy is a broader term referring to fairtreatment of individuals, including transparency, ethical use, and privacy rights.Empathy. The relation of that with security is that the feasible level of security shouldalways be taken into account when validating a certain application of Aෲ. ෲf a sufficient levelof security cannot be provided to individuals or organizations, then empathy meansinvalidating the idea, or takin other precautions.",

We let LLMs control and create things and may have too muchtrust in how correct they are, and also underestimate the risk of them being manipulated.The result is that attacks can have much impact.Regarding training: Since the training sets are so large and based on public data, it is easierto perform data poisoning.

How can Aෲ-generated sourcecode be licensed and exploited by third parties?These questions are not easily resolved, as the current ෲP legal and regulatory framework doesnot adequately address the ෲP status of Aෲ- generated works. Furthermore, the Aෲ-generatedsource code may not be entirely novel, as it may be derived from existing code or data sources.Therefore, it is essential to conduct a thorough analysis of the origin and the process of the Aෲ-generated source code, to determine its ෲP implications and ensure the safeguarding of thecompany’s ෲP assets.
