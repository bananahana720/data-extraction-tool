Sample Test Document

Introduction
This is a sample document for testing the text extraction functionality.
It contains multiple paragraphs, headings, and different types of content.

Background
The document extraction tool processes various file formats including
DOCX, PDF, PPTX, and XLSX files. This simple text file serves as a
basic fixture for testing core extraction logic.

Testing Approach
When testing extractors, we follow these patterns:
1. Test successful extraction with valid files
2. Test error handling with invalid files
3. Test format-specific features
4. Test edge cases like empty or very large files

Expected Results
This file should be extracted as:
- A heading block for each section title
- Paragraph blocks for each text section
- Proper sequence ordering maintained

Conclusion
This fixture file provides a baseline for testing text extraction
capabilities of the system.
